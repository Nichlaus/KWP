A friend of Jesus, O what bliss.That one so vile as IShould ever have a friend like thisTo lead me to the sky.CHORUSFriendship with Jesus,Fellowship divine,O what a blessed, sweet communion.Jesus is a friend of mine.A friend when other friendships cease,A friend when others fail,A friend who gives me joy and peace,A friend when foes assail.CHORUSFriendship with Jesus,Fellowship divine,O what a blessed, sweet communion.Jesus is a friend of mine.A friend when sickness lays me low,A friend when death draws near,A friend as through the vale I go,A friend to help and cheer.CHORUSFriendship with Jesus,Fellowship divine,O what a blessed, sweet communion.Jesus is a friend of mine. A friend when life's short race is o'er, A friend when earth is past, A friend to meet on heaven's shore, A friend when home at last. CHORUS Friendship with Jesus, Fellowship divine, O what a blessed, sweet communion. Jesus is a friend of mine.
