 If I have failed to comfort my brother If he needs help and I scorn him away If I have brought to your heart disappointments Dear Lord forgive the way I have lived and teach me Thy way. CHORUS Teach me to walk in the footsteps of Jesus Teach me to hear what you have to say Help me bear the cross you have given Hold to my hand,help me to stand And teach me Thy way. When I must speak to those that do not know you When I grow tired of the long weary day When I must wait for an answer from heaven Give me Thy grace, increase my faith And teach me Thy way. CHORUS Teach me to walk in the footsteps of Jesus Teach me to hear what you have to say Help me bear the cross you have given Hold to my hand,help me to stand And teach me Thy way. If I must talk to those that do not know you If I must journey down the long life's road If I must bear the burden of others Give me Thy grace increase my faith, And teach me Thy way. CHORUS Teach me to walk in the footsteps of Jesus Teach me to hear what you have to say Help me bear the cross you have given Hold to my hand,help me to stand And teach me Thy way.
