 Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way, And was wretched and vile as could be; But my Saviour above, gave me peace, joy and love, When He reached down His hand for me, for me. CHORUS When He reached down His hand for me, When He reached down His hand for me; I was lost and undone, without God or His Son, When He reached down His hand for me, for me. I was nearing despair, when He came to me there, And He showed me that I could be free; Then He lifted my feet, gave me glory complete, When He reached down His hand for me, for me. CHORUS When He reached down His hand for me, When He reached down His hand for me; I was lost and undone, without God or His Son, When He reached down His hand for me, for me. How my heart doth rejoice since I made Him my choice, From the tempest to Him now I flee; Now I lean on His arm I'm secure from all harm, Since he reached down His hand for me, for me. CHORUS When He reached down His hand for me, When He reached down His hand for me; I was lost and undone, without God or His Son, When He reached down His hand for me, for me. Since the Lord gave me peace,heavenly joys never cease; Lord, I give all my life unto Thee; Guide my feet,hold my hand, grant with Thee I may stand, For you reached down your hand for me, for me. CHORUS When He reached down His hand for me, When He reached down His hand for me; I was lost and undone, without God or His Son, When He reached down His hand for me, for me.
