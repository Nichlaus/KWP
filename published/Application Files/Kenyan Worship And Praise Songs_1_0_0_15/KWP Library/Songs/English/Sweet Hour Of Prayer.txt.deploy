Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,That calls me from a world of care,And bids me, at my Father's throne,Make all my wants and wishes known;In seasons of distress and grief,My soul has often found relief,And oft escaped the tempter's snare,By Thy return, sweet hour of prayer.Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,The joy I feel, the bliss I share,Of those whose anxious spirits burnWith strong desires for Thy return!With such I hasten to the placeWhere God, my Saviour, shows His face,And gladly take my station there,And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,Thy wings shall my petition bearTo Him shall my petition bearEngage the waiting soul to bless;And since He bids me seek His face,Believe His Word and trust His grace,I'll cast on Him my every care,And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.
