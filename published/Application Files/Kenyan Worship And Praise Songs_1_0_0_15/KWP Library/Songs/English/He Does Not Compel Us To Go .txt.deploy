 When the Canaanites hardened their hearts against God And grieved Him because of their Sins God sent along hornets to bring them to terms And help His own people to win The hornets persuaded them that it was best To go quickly and not to go slow God did not compel them to go against their will But He just made them willing to go. CHORUS God does not compel us to go (anywhere) He does not compel us to go (oh no) God does not compel us to go against our will But He just makes us willing to go. If a nest of live hornets were sent to this room And the creatures allowed to go free You would not need urging to make yourself scared You would want to get out don't you see They would not hold or by force of their strength Throw you out of the window, Oh, no! They would not compel you to go against your will They would just make you willing to go. CHORUS God does not compel us to go (anywhere) He does not compel us to go (oh no) God does not compel us to go against our will But He just makes us willing to go. When Jonah was sent to the work of the Lord The outlook was not very bright He did not need urging to make himself scared So he packed and ran off from the fight But God sent a big fish to swallow him up The story I'm sure you all know God did not compel him to go against his will, But He just made him willing to go. CHORUS God does not compel us to go (anywhere) He does not compel us to go (oh no) God does not compel us to go against our will But He just makes us willing to go.
