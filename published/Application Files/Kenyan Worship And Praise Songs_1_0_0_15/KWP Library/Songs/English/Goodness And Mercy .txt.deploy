 A pilgrim was I and a-wandering In the cold night of sin I did roam, When Jesus, the kind Shepherd found me, And now I'm on my way home. CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy, Shall follow me,all the days All the days of my life (x2) He restoreth my soul when I'm weary He giveth me strength day by day He leads me, beside the still waters He guards me each step of the way. CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy, Shall follow me,all the days All the days of my life (x2) When I walk through the dark lonesome valley, My Saviour will walk with me there And safely His great hand will lead me To the mansions He's gone to prepare. CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy, Shall follow me,all the days All the days of my life (x2) Surely goodness and mercy Shall follow me, all the days All the days of my life (x2) And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever And I shall feast at the table spread for me Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life. CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy, Shall follow me,all the days All the days of my life (x2)
