 God walks the dark hills, The ways, the by-ways He walks on the billows of life's troubled sea He walks in the cold, dark nights, The shadows, the mid-nights God walks the dark hills Just to guide you and me. CHORUS God walks the dark hills To guide my footstep. He walks everyday, By night and by day, He walks in silence, All down the highway God walks the dark hills, To show me the way. Then God walks in the storms, The rain and the sunshine He walks on the billows or through Glimmering lights Helps us walk up the mountain so High Cross our rivers through valleys God walks the dark hills, Cos He loves you and me. CHORUS God walks the dark hills To guide my footstep. He walks everyday, By night and by day, He walks in silence, All down the highway God walks the dark hills, To show me the way.
