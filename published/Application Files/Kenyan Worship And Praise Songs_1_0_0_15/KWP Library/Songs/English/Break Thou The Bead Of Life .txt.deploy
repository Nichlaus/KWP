 Break Thou the Bread of Life, Dear Lord, to me, As Thou did'st break the bread Beside the sea; Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord, My spirit longs for Thee, Thou living Word. Thou art the Bread of Life, Oh Lord, to me, Thy Holy Word the truth That saveth me; Give me to eat and live With Thee above, Teach to love Thy truth, For Thou art love. Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord, Now unto me, - That He may touch my eyes And make me see; Show me the truth concealed Within Thy Word, And in Thy Book revealed, I see Thee, Lord. Bless Thou the Bread of Life To me, to me, As Thou didst bless the loaves By Galilee; Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall, And I shall find my peace, My all in all.
