 I've been redeemed, By the blood of the Lamb I've been redeemed By the blood of the Lamb I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Saved and sanctified I am All my sins are under the blood I've been redeemed. And that's not all (and that's not all) There's more beside (there's more beside) And that's not all there's more beside I've been to the river and been baptised In the name of Jesus Christ I've been redeemed. My Lord and I (my Lord and I) We've got so close (we've got so close) My Lord and I we've got so close My Lord and I we've got so close He baptized me with the Holy Ghost All my sins are under the blood I've been redeemed.
