 Like the woman brought to Jesus Who was taken in her sin I was so ashamed of what I^d done And where I had been When justice called the payment It was more than I could give Then mercy smiled upon me Saying, I forgive The sweetest words He ever said was I forgive Each sin and stain was wiped away And I could live Well I could have been told About a mansion He could give But the sweetest words He ever said was, I forgive. So when you are tired of living with the wrong That you have done, Come on home to Jesus you know He is plain in words, In His hands He will hold you And you just begin to live When you hear Him whisper, I forgive The sweetest words He ever said was I forgive Each sin and stain was wiped away And I could live Well I liked the part where He told About a mansion He could give But the sweetest words He ever said was, I forgive. Oh I could have been told about A mansion He could give, But the sweetest words He ever said was I F-O-R-G-I-V-E, I FORGIVE!
