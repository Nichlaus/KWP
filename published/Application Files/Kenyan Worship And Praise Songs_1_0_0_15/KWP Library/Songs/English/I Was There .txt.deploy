 Before the moon or the sun,or the time had begun, Before that God ever said Let there be Light, Before there was a grain of sand, I was in the Master's plan, I was there, hallelujah,I was there. Before this earth did appear,or there was an atmosphere, Before there ever was a star to grace the sky, When the sons of God did sing,praise and Glory to the King I was there,hallelujah I was there. When my Saviour gave His life,shed His Blood and paid the price, When mountains shook and the veil was rent in twain, When the spear did pierce His side, He was travailing for His Bride, I was there,hallelujah,I was there. Now as I walk this earthly race My faith is anchored in my God And I'll not fear as through this valley I must cross Christ is living in my heart His Word has said He will not depart And He is there,hallelujah, He is there. Till the trump of God should sound, Calling me to higher realms, My eyes are fixed on Jesus Christ My Lord and King, Soon He'll call His waiting Bride,to be ever at His side, Then I'll be there,Oh hallelujah, I'll be there.
