 As a child I so foolishly turned away Not knowing the heartache a sinner must face But my Father in His goodness has made me return To share with His children this lesson I've learnt. CHORUS Sin will take you farther than you want to go Slowly and wholly taking control Sin will keep you longer than you want to stay Sin will cost you far more than you want to pay. So with pleasures and promises sin took control, Leaving me dying with nothing to show Gone were my loved ones and my dearest friends Only a Saviour, could love me again. CHORUS Sin will take you farther than you want to go Slowly and wholly taking control Sin will keep you longer than you want to stay Sin will cost you far more than you want to pay.
