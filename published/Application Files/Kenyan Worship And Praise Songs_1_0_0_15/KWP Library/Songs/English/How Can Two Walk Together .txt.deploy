 It all started in the garden of Eden, When the first two were born in sin Now Cain was the seed of the serpent And Abel was the true seed of God. CHORUS How can two walk together, Unless they both agree, One believes In trinity doctrine And the other believes In one God. Now Cain looked for fame and beauty, While Abel sought the face of God, Now they tried to walk together But they found they could not agree. CHORUS How can two walk together, Unless they both agree, One believes In trinity doctrine And the other believes In one God. Those two spirits that started in Eden, Still rule over man's heart today One spirit will give you worldly wisdom And the other the true Word of God. CHORUS How can two walk together, Unless they both agree, One believes In trinity doctrine And the other believes In one God.
