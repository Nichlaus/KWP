 Standing there at the Red sea God's people begun to complain Saying Pharaoh and his mighty army Will take us to bondage again Stand still and see the salvation Of the Lord Moses cried Then God came parted the waters And they crossed to the other side. CHORUS God delivers again Oh my God delivers again When it seems that all is lost He reaches down His hand Then all the forces of evil have to flee At His command Just when things look hopeless My God delivers again. We^ll never bow to your idols The Hebrew children proclaimed So the King gave the command To throw them into the flame Then he said did we not cast three men Into the furnace fire I see four men now loose in the fire Unhurt and are walking around. CHORUS God delivers again Oh my God delivers again When it seems that all is lost He reaches down His hand Then all the forces of evil have to flee At His command Just when things look hopeless My God delivers again.
