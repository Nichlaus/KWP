My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah's wings dread frown,And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down;I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.CHORUSHe brought me out of the clay,He set my feet on the rocks to stay;He puts a song in my soul today,A song of praise,hallelujah!He placed me upon the Rock by His side,My steps were established and here I^ll abide;No danger of falling while here I remain,But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.CHORUSHe brought me out of the clay,He set my feet on the rocks to stay;He puts a song in my soul today,A song of praise,hallelujah!He gave me a song,'twas a new song of praise,By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;My heart's overflowing,I'm happy and free,I'll praise my redeemer,who has rescued me.CHORUSHe brought me out of the clay,He set my feet on the rocks to stay;He puts a song in my soul today,A song of praise,hallelujah!I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,I'll praise him till all men his goodness shall see;I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.CHORUSHe brought me out of the clay,He set my feet on the rocks to stay;He puts a song in my soul today,A song of praise,hallelujah!
