 There is life for a look at the Crucified One, There is life at this moment for thee; Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be sav'd, Unto Him who was nailed to the tree. CHORUS Look! look and live! There Is life for a look at the crucified One, There Is life at this moment for thee. It is not thy tears of repentance nor prayers, But the blood that atones for the soul; On Him then believe,and a pardon receive, For His blood now can make thee quite whole. CHORUS Look! look and live! There Is life for a look at the crucified One, There Is life at this moment for thee. We are healed by His stripes; wouldst thou add to the word? And He is our righteousness made; The best robe of heaven He bids thee to wear, Oh,couldst thou be better arrayed? CHORUS Look! look and live! There Is life for a look at the crucified One, There Is life at this moment for thee. Then doubt not thy welcome,since God has declared, There remaineth no more to be done; That once in the end of the world He appeared, And completed the work He'd begun. CHORUS Look! look and live! There Is life for a look at the crucified One, There Is life at this moment for thee. But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once, The life everlasting He gives; And know with assurance thou never canst die, Since Jesus thy righteousness lives. CHORUS Look! look and live! There Is life for a look at the crucified One, There Is life at this moment for thee.
