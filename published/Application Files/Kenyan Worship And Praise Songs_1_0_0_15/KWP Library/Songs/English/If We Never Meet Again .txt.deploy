 Soon we'll come to the end of life^s journey And perhaps, we'll never meet any more, Till we gather in heaven's bright city Far away on that beautiful shore. CHORUS Where the charming roses bloom,forever, And where separations come no more, If we never meet again this side of heaven I'll meet you on that beautiful shore. Oh they say we'll meet by the river, Where no stormy clouds ever darken the sky And they say we'll be happy in heaven, In that wonderful sweet by and by. CHORUS Where the charming roses bloom,forever, And where separations come no more, If we never meet again this side of heaven I'll meet you on that beautiful shore.
