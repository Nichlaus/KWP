 CHORUS Thank God I am free, free, free From this world of sin, Washed In the blood of Jesus, I've been born again, Hallelujah, I am saved, saved, Saved by His wonderful grace, I'm so glad that I found out He would bring me out and show me the way. For a long time I travelled,down a long lonely road, My heart was so heavy with sin and sunk low, But when I heard about Jesus,what a wonderful hour, I'm so glad that I found out, He would bring me out and show me the way. CHORUS Thank God I am free, free, free From this world of sin, Washed In the blood of Jesus, I've been born again, Hallelujah, I am saved, saved, Saved by His wonderful grace, I'm so glad that I found out He would bring me out and show me the way. Like a bird out of prison that's taken it's flight, Like a blind man that God gave back his sight Like a poor wretched beggar that's found fortune and fame I'm so glad that I found out, He would bring me out and show me the way. CHORUS Thank God I am free, free, free From this world of sin, Washed In the blood of Jesus, I've been born again, Hallelujah, I am saved, saved, Saved by His wonderful grace, I'm so glad that I found out He would bring me out and show me the way.
