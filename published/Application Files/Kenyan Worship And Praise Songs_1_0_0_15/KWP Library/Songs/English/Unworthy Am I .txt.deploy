 Unworthy am I, of the grace that He gave, Unworthy to hold His hand Amazed that a King would reach down to a slave His love I cannot understand. CHORUS Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar In bondage and alone, But He made me worthy, And now by His grace, His mercy has made me His own. My sorrows and sickness laid stripes on His back, My sins caused the blood that was shed, My faults and my failures have won Him a crown, Of thorns that He wore on His head. CHORUS Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar In bondage and alone, But He made me worthy, And now by His grace, His mercy has made me His own. Unworthy am I of the glory divine, Unworthy with angels to stay, It thrills just to know that He loves so much, A pauper I walk with the King. CHORUS Unworthy, unworthy, a beggar In bondage and alone, But He made me worthy, And now by His grace, His mercy has made me His own.
