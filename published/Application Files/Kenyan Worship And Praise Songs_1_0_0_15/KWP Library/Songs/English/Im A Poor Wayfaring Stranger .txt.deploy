 I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger, Travelling through this world of woe, Yet there's no sickness,sorrow or danger In that bright land to which I go. I'm going there to see my Father I'm going there no more to roam, I'm just going over Jordan I'm just going over home. And though dark clouds will gather round me I know my way is rough and steep Yet beauteous fields lie just before rne Where God's redeemed their vigils keep. I'm going there to see my mother, She said she'd meet me when I come I'm only going over jordan I'm only going over home.
