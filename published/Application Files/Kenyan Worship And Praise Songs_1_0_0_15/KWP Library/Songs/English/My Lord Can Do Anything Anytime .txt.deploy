 CHORUS My Lord can do anything,anytime, anywhere, My Lord can do anything, He makes the lame to rise and walk, The deaf to hear, the blind to see, My Lord can do anything. He calmed the raging storms with His Word Peace be still' Jesus said and that was all; He raised the dead Lazarus,after four days in the grave, (My Lord x2) can do anything. CHORUS My Lord can do anything,anytime, anywhere, My Lord can do anything, He makes the lame to rise and walk, The deaf to hear, the blind to see, My Lord can do anything. Let your hearts not be troubled my Jesus said, As you believe in the Father believe in Me, In my Father's house there are many mansions there; Behold I go to prepare you a place. CHORUS My Lord can do anything,anytime, anywhere, My Lord can do anything, He makes the lame to rise and walk, The deaf to hear, the blind to see, My Lord can do anything. Then to the twelve disciples Jesus said; Behold I go to the Father,but I'll return, If you abide in my Word then Ill abide in you, And then by my power you will do anything. CHORUS My Lord can do anything,anytime, anywhere, My Lord can do anything, He makes the lame to rise and walk, The deaf to hear, the blind to see, My Lord can do anything. How my heart doth rejoice just to know That one morning my Lord shall speak and all be changed Then He shall call the names of saints And from the dead they shall rise in the resurrection morning, My Lord can do everything! CHORUS My Lord can do anything,anytime, anywhere, My Lord can do anything, He makes the lame to rise and walk, The deaf to hear, the blind to see, My Lord can do anything.
