 Years of time, are swiftly passing Bringing nearer heaven's goal Soon I'll be at home with Jesus While eternal ages roll. CHORUS Oh how precious is the promise That with gladness fills my soul I shall be at home with Jesus While eternal ages roll After the last farewells are spoken I shall meet my dear ones I've known In the presence of my Saviour When we stand before His Throne. CHORUS Oh how precious is the promise That with gladness fills my soul I shall be at home with Jesus While eternal ages roll
