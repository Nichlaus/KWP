 Oh the judgement day is coming What an awful day 'twill be, Christ forever is my refuge Rock of Ages cleft for me. CHORUS Oh, my loving brother, When the world's on fire, Don't you want God's bosom To be your pillow, Hide me ever in the Rock of Ages Rock of Ages cleft for me, At the sounding of the trumpet, At the dawning of the day, Worldly pleasures with their treasures Shall forever pass away. CHORUS Oh, my loving brother, When the world's on fire, Don't you want God's bosom To be your pillow, Hide me ever in the Rock of Ages Rock of Ages cleft for me, Poor lost sinners will be crying, For the home they'll never see, But the ransomed will be singing Rock of Ages, cleft for me. CHORUS Oh, my loving brother, When the world's on fire, Don't you want God's bosom To be your pillow, Hide me ever in the Rock of Ages Rock of Ages cleft for me,
