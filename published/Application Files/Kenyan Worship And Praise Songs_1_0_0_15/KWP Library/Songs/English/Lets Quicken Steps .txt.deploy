 CHORUS Let's quicken the steps We will win the race Watching for the dawning of eternal joy He's coming again,the King of Kings To take His own from this sinful world Oh praise the Lord We will win the race Just a few more steps for a crown. I will stand, I will stand Because I'm certain of life x 2 CHORUS Let's quicken the steps We will win the race Watching for the dawning of eternal joy He's coming again,the King of Kings To take His own from this sinful world Oh praise the Lord We will win the race Just a few more steps for a crown. I will strife on, I will strife The hope is brighter, let us move x 2 CHORUS Let's quicken the steps We will win the race Watching for the dawning of eternal joy He's coming again,the King of Kings To take His own from this sinful world Oh praise the Lord We will win the race Just a few more steps for a crown. The call is loud out from sins Come and join the race We are going home. CHORUS Let's quicken the steps We will win the race Watching for the dawning of eternal joy He's coming again,the King of Kings To take His own from this sinful world Oh praise the Lord We will win the race Just a few more steps for a crown.
