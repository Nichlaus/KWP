 If I come to Jesus He will make me glad He will give me pleasure When my heart is sad CHORUS If I come to Jesus Happy I shall be He is gently calling Little ones like me If I come to Jesus, He will hear my prayer; For He loves me dearly, And my sins did bear CHORUS If I come to Jesus Happy I shall be He is gently calling Little ones like me There, with happy children Robed in snowy white, I shall see my saviour, In that world so bright CHORUS If I come to Jesus Happy I shall be He is gently calling Little ones like me
