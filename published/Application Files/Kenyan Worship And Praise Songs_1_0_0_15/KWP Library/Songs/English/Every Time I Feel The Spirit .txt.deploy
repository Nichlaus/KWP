 CHORUS Upon the mountain my Lord spoke Out of His mouth came fire and smoke I looked all around me it looked so fine I asked my Lord if all was mine. CHORUS Every time I feel the Spirit Moving In my heart I will pray Every time I feel the spirit Moving In my heart I will pray. Jordan river, chilly and cold Chills the body not the soul There is but one train upon this track It goes to heaven and then right back. CHORUS Upon the mountain my Lord spoke Out of His mouth came fire and smoke I looked all around me it looked so fine I asked my Lord if all was mine. Oh I've got sorrows and I've got woes And I have got heartaches here below So when I am praying down on my knees Oh, help me Jesus if you may please. CHORUS Upon the mountain my Lord spoke Out of His mouth came fire and smoke I looked all around me it looked so fine I asked my Lord if all was mine. Some people worry,and some complain The way they grumble it is a shame I try to tell them of a better way Of the Spirit and how to pray. CHORUS Upon the mountain my Lord spoke Out of His mouth came fire and smoke I looked all around me it looked so fine I asked my Lord if all was mine.
