 The news came to Jesus please come fast Lazarus is sick and without your help he will not last Mary and Martha watched their brother die They waited for Jesus, He did not come They wondered why The death watch was over, buried four days Somebody said Hell soon be here The Lords on His way Martha ran to Him and then she cried Lord if you had been here, you could have healed him, he^d still be alive! CHORUS But you are four days late and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why Youve waited so long But His way is Gods way not yours or mine And isnt it great When Hes four days late Hes still on time. Jesus said Martha, show me the grave But she said Lord you dont understand Hes been there four days! The grave stone was rolled back, Then Jesus cried, Lazarus come forth! Then somebody said Hes ALIVE! Hes ALIVE CHORUS But you are four days late and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why Youve waited so long But His way is Gods way not yours or mine And isnt it great When Hes four days late Hes still on time. You may be fighting a battle of fear Youve cried to the Lord I need you now! But He has not appeared friend dont be discouraged Cause Hes still the same Hell soon be here and Hell roll back your stone and Hell call out your name CHORUS But you are four days late and all hope is gone Lord we don't understand why Youve waited so long But His way is Gods way not yours or mine And isnt it great When Hes four days late Hes still on time.
