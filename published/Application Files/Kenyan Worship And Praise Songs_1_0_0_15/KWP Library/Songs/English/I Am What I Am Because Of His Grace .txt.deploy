 I could stand here and tell you what I used to be I could tell of the change thats come over me But the Lord showed His grace when He died on the tree So Ill let the blood Jesus shed speak for me CHORUS I am what I am because of His grace For one spotless lamb died in my place All my sins are forgiven, my past is erased I am what I am because of His grace I was lost and undone Now found and fulfilled God traded His son for my shame and guilt Now Im His child No longer sins slave CHORUS His mercy ha made me what I am to day I am what I am because of His grace For one spotless lamb died in my place All my sins are forgiven my past is erased I am what I am because of His grace Now Im a bride to the King Robed in my wedding gown Place my life in His hands and He wont let me down Faithful and true without spot or stain What I am today was always in His plan CHORUS I am what I am because of His grace For one spotless lamb died in my place All my sins are forgiven my past is erased I am what I am because of His grace
