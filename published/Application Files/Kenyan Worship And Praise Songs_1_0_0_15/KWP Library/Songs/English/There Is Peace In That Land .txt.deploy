 When my soul was disturbed with sorrows And my heart was burdened with pain Jesus opened His arms of mercy And He tenderly took me in. CHORUS There is peace in the time of troubles There is peace in the midst of all storms There is peace though the world be raging In the shelter of His own arms. There are storms that we often encounter Do not fear they will do you no harm In the storms you will find protection In the shelter of His arms. CHORUS There is peace in the time of troubles There is peace in the midst of all storms There is peace though the world be raging In the shelter of His own arms.
