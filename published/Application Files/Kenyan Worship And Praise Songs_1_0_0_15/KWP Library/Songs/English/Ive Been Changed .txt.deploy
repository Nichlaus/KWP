 Well,I've been to the river and I've been baptized, I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb; I've been changed from the creature that once I was, And Redeemed is now my name. CHORUS I've been changed! I am new born now, All my life has been rearranged; What a difference it made, When the Lord came and stayed In my heart, Oh yes,I've been changed. Satan once ruled my heart but Jesus rescued me, By His Grace, I can say I've been redeemed; I've been changed from the nature that once held me, Where I was bound,I now am free. CHORUS I've been changed! I am new born now, All my life has been rearranged; What a difference it made, When the Lord came and stayed In my heart, Oh yes,I've been changed.
