 Oh what a wonderful,wonderful day Day I'll never forget, After I'd wandered in darkness away Jesus my Saviour I met, Oh what a tender,compassionate friend, He met the needs of my heart Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling He made all the darkness depart. CHORUS Heavens came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross my Saviour made me whole, My sins were washed away, And my night was turned to day Heavens came down and glory filled my soul. Born of the spirit with life from above, Into God's family divine, Justified fully through calvary's love, Oh what a standing is mine, And the transaction so quickly was made, When as a sinner I came, Took up the offer of grace He did offer He saved me O praise His dear name. CHORUS Heavens came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross my Saviour made me whole, My sins were washed away, And my night was turned to day Heavens came down and glory filled my soul. Now I have hope that I^ll surely endure, After the passing of time, I have a future in heaven for sure, There in those mansions sublime, And it's because of that wonderful day, When at the cross I believed, Riches eternal and blessing supernal, From His precious hand I received. CHORUS Heavens came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross my Saviour made me whole, My sins were washed away, And my night was turned to day Heavens came down and glory filled my soul.
