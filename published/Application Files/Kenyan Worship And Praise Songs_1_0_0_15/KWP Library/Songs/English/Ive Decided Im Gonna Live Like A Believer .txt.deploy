 CHORUS I have decided, Am gonna live like a believer, Turn my back on the deciever, Am gonna live what I Believe. I have decided, being good is just a fable, I just can't cause am not able Am gonna leave it to the Lord. There is a wealth of good that I professed I said that I believed But deep inside I never changed, I guess I had been deceived, Cause the voice inside kept telling me I'll change by and by But the Spirit made it clear to me, That kind of life is lie. CHORUS I have decided, Am gonna live like a believer, Turn my back on the deciever, Am gonna live what I Believe. I have decided, being good is just a fable, I just can't cause am not able Am gonna leave it to the Lord. So forget the game of being good, And your self righteousness Cause the only good inside of your heart Is the good that Jesus brings When the world begins to see you changed Don't expect them to applaud Just put your eyes on Him and say, I've become the work of God CHORUS I have decided, Am gonna live like a believer, Turn my back on the deciever, Am gonna live what I Believe. I have decided, being good is just a fable, I just can't cause am not able Am gonna leave it to the Lord.
