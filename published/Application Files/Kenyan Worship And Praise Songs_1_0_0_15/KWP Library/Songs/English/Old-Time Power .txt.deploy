 They were in an upper chamber, They were all with one accord, When the Holy Ghost descended As was promised by our Lord. CHORUS O Lord, send the power just now,  O Lord, send the power just now;  O Lord, send the power just now  And baptize every one.  Yes, this power from heaven descended  With the sound of rushing wind;  Tongues of fire came down upon them,  As the Lord said He would send.  CHORUS  O Lord, send the power just now,  O Lord, send the power just now;  O Lord, send the power just now  And baptize every one.  Yes, this old time power was given  To our fathers who were true;  This is promised to believers,  And we all may have it too.  CHORUS  O Lord, send the power just now,  O Lord, send the power just now;  O Lord, send the power just now  And baptize every one.
