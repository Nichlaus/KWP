 There was a ship once rolling gently Over the sea the Saviour made; All the disciples of His were in it as together this time they stayed But the Great Captain was not with them, On the shore He was delayed, They saw a man come walking on the waters saying: It's I be not afraid! Oh! it is I be not afraid CHORUS Oh! it is I be not afraid This is the reply that the Saviour made Though the night was dark and the wind was blowing Still with the ship the disciples stayed, They saw a man Come walking on the waters saying It is I be not afraid! Aren't you glad you claim a Saviour who can calm the wind and sea, While this is the same Dear Jesus who said: Come unto me So let's go to the ship's salvation one that sin has never swayed Jesus is calling to us gently saying: It^s I be not afraid! CHORUS Oh! it is I be not afraid This is the reply that the Saviour made Though the night was dark and the wind was blowing Still with the ship the disciples stayed, They saw a man Come walking on the waters saying It is I be not afraid!
