 I used to think money and pleasures, Were all that life had to Offer to me My life was so filled with joys of this world How blind, oh how blind could I be? CHORUS Jesus me whole, yes His Love is as pure as gold His mercies are treasures untold; Until you've known Jesus Then you will never see, What the joy of living can be. I fell on my knees and I could not explain What took place with me there and then, But things that had once seemed like pleasures to me No more of those things did I crave. CHORUS Jesus me whole, yes His Love is as pure as gold His mercies are treasures untold; Until you've known Jesus Then you will never see, What the joy of living can be.
