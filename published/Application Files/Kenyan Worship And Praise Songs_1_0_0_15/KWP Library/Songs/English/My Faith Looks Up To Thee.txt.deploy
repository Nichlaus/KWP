My faith looks up to thee,Thou lamb of Calvary,Saviour divine,Now hear me while I pray,Take all my sin away,Oh let me from this dayBe wholly Thine!May Thy rich grace impartStrength to my fainting heart,My zeal inspire;As thou has died for me,Oh may my love to thee,Pure, warm, and changeless be,A living fire!While life's dark maze I tread,And griefs around me spread,Be Thou my Guide;Bid darkness turn to day,Wipe sorrow's tears away,Nor let me ever strayFrom Thee aside.
