 There is a story in the bible of Elisha A Shunnamite woman and her son The woman found favor with God And He gave her a son While working in the fields, the little boy died But the womans faith never failed Even in death she testified That all is well CHORUS All is well (x2) We have heard the message Shalom And all is well There is place of perfect rest Behind the inner veil So rest, little bride rest, For all is well No things have not worked out Like Gods people thought For we are here still fighting The greatest battle ever fought We must have the faith of Abraham Knowing Gods word never fails If we trust in Him well find, All is well CHORUS All is well (x2) We have heard the message Shalom And all is well There is place of perfect rest Behind the inner veil So rest, little bride rest, For all is well
