 When I consider The works of your fingers The sun and the stars The land and the sea I start to wonder Almighty Creator Just why you would ever Take thought of me. 1st CHORUS Yet you have called me by name You are acquainted with all my ways Bought by your blood, drawn by your love, I am your dwelling place. 2nd CHORUS For you have called me your friend Showing me favour again and again I'm set apart close to your side You called me by name. All of creation was made for your pleasure The sun and the stars, the land and the sea But by your grace, you have given me favour With you I will dwell for eternity. 1st CHORUS Bought by your blood Drawn by your love I am your dwelling place. 2nd CHORUS I am set apart Close to your side You called me by name.
