Let me walk, blessed Lord, in the way thou has done,Leading straight to the land above;Giving cheer, to the sad and the lone,Fill my way everyday with love.CHORUSFill my way everyday with love,As I walk with the heavenly dove;Let me go all the while, with a song and a smile,Fill my way everyday with love.Keep close to the side of my Saviour and Guide,Let me never in darkness rove;Keep my path free from wrath, and my soul satisfied,Fill my way everyday with love.CHORUSFill my way everyday with love,As I walk with the heavenly dove;Let me go all the while, with a song and a smile,Fill my way everyday with love.Soon the race will be o'er and travel no more,But abide with my home above;let me sing, blessed king, all the way to the shore,Fill my way everyday with love.CHORUSFill my way everyday with love,As I walk with the heavenly dove;Let me go all the while, with a song and a smile,Fill my way everyday with love.
