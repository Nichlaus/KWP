Jesus is my Savior, I shall not be moved;In His love and favor, I shall not be moved,Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,Lord, I shall not be moved.ChorusI shall not be, I shall not be moved;I shall not be, I shall not be moved;Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,Lord, I shall not be moved.In my Christ abiding, I shall not be moved;In His love I'm hiding, I shall not be moved,Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,Lord, I shall not be moved.If I trust Him ever, I shall not be moved;He will fail me never, I shall not be moved,Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,Lord, I shall not be moved.On His word I'm feeding, I shall not be moved;He's the One that's leading, I shall not be moved,Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,Lord, I shall not be moved.
