 I looked over Jordan and what did I see Coming for to carry me home; A band of angels coming after me, Coming for to carry me home. CHORUS Swing low, sweet chariot, Coming for to carry me home; Swing low, sweet chariot, Coming for to carry me home. If you get there before I do, Coming for to carry me home; Tell all my friends I'm a-coming too, Coming for to carry me home. CHORUS Swing low, sweet chariot, Coming for to carry me home; Swing low, sweet chariot, Coming for to carry me home.
