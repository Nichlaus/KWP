 He paid a debt He did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay, I needed someone to wash my sins away; And now I sing a brand new song, Amazing grace all day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt That I could never pay. He paid a debt at Calvary, He cleansed my soul and set me free, I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erase. I now can sing a brand new song, Amazing grace all day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt That I could never pay. One day He's coming back for me, To live with Him eternally, Won't it be glory to see Him on that day! I then will sing a brand new song, Amazing grace all day long Christ Jesus paid a debt That I could never pay.
