 No tears in heaven,no sorrows even, All will be glory in that land, There'll be no sadness,all will be gladness, When we'll join our heavenly band. CHORUS No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, Sorrows and pain will all have gone, No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, No tears in heaven will be known. Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder, Soon we will enter eternal gates There with our Saviour we'll be forever Where no sorrows can dismay. CHORUS No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, Sorrows and pain will all have gone, No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, No tears in heaven will be known. Some morning yonder, We'll cease to ponder, Over all this life has brought to view, All will be nearer, loved ones be dearer, In heaven where all will be made new. CHORUS No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, Sorrows and pain will all have gone, No tears in heaven, no tears In heaven, No tears in heaven will be known.
