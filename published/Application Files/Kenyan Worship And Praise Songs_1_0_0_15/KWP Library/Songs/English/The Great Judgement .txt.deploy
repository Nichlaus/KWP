 I dreamed that the great judgement morning Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown; I dreamed that the nations had gathered To judgement before the white throne; From the throne came a bright shining angel, And stood on the land and the sea, And swore with his hand raised to heaven, That time was no longer to be. CHORUS And O, what a weeping and wailing, As the lost were told of their fate; They cried for the rocks and the mountains, They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The rich man was there, but his money Had melted and vanished away; A pauper he stood in the judgement, His debts were too heavy to pay; The great man was there, but his greatness, When death came, was left far behind. The angel that opened the records, Not a trace of his greatness could find. CHORUS And O, what a weeping and wailing, As the lost were told of their fate; They cried for the rocks and the mountains, They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The widow was there with the orphans, God heard and remembered their cries; No sorrow in heaven forever. God wiped all the tears from their eyes; The gambler was there and the drunkard, And the man that had sold them the drink, With the people who gave him the license, Together in hell they did sink. CHORUS And O, what a weeping and wailing, As the lost were told of their fate; They cried for the rocks and the mountains, They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The moral man came to the judgement, But his self-righteous rags would not do; The men who had crucified Jesus Had passed off as moral men, too; The soul that had put off salvation, No time now to think of religion! At last they had found time to die. CHORUS And O, what a weeping and wailing, As the lost were told of their fate; They cried for the rocks and the mountains, They prayed, but their prayers were too late.
