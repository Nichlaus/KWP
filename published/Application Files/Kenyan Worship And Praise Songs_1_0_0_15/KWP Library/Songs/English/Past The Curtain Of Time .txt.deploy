 There's a curtain that's drawn between earth and Heaven, And just beyond lies a beautiful clime Where the evils of this life no longer can touch me; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. CHORUS Lord, let me look past the curtain of sorrows and fear. Let me view that sunny bright clime; It would strengthen my faith and would banish all fear; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. I^m helpless, alone, and I want to see Jesus, And hear the sweet harbor bells chime, Where my friends and dear loved ones are waiting for me; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. CHORUS Lord, let me look past the curtain of sorrows and fear. Let me view that sunny bright clime; It would strengthen my faith and would banish all fear; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. I'm so homesick and blue, and I want to see Jesus, I would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime; It would brighten my path and would vanish all fear; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. CHORUS Lord, let me look past the curtain of sorrows and fear. Let me view that sunny bright clime; It would strengthen my faith and would banish all fear; Lord, let me look past the curtain of time.
