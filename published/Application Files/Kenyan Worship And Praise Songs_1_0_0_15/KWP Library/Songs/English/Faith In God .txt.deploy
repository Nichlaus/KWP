 Faith in God can move a mighty mountain, Faith in God can calm the troubled sea; Faith in God makes sweet the bitter fountain, Faith can give the victory, CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days,all the days of my life; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days,all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever, And I shall feast at the table spread for me; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, All the days,all the days of my life. CHORUS Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days,all the days of my life; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days,all the days of my life.
