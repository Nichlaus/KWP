 Here so many are taking vacation, To the mountains, the lakes or the sea; Where they rest from their cares and their worries, What a wonderful time that must be! But it seems not my lot to be like them, I must toil thru the heat and the cold, Seeking out the lost sheep on the mountains, Bringing wanderers back to the fold. CHORUS When I take my vacation in heaven, What a wonderful time that will be; Hearing concerts by the heavenly, And the face of my Savior I'll see; Sitting down by the banks of the river; 'Neath the shade of the ever green tree, I shall rest from my burdens forever, Won't you spend your vacation with me. Now some day I shall take my vacation To the city John tells us about; With its foundation walls all so precious, Where from gladness of heart I shall shout! O no sights ever witnessed by mortals, Can compare with the glories up there I shall spend my vacation with Jesus, In the place He went on to prepare. CHORUS When I take my vacation in heaven, What a wonderful time that will be; Hearing concerts by the heavenly, And the face of my Savior I'll see; Sitting down by the banks of the river; 'Neath the shade of the ever green tree, I shall rest from my burdens forever, Won't you spend your vacation with me. There the weather will always be perfect. Not a cloud shall sweep over the sky; And no earthquakes or cyclones shall threaten, In the land of the Sweet by and by Soon there's going to be an excursion, I am booked for a ride in the air. You're invited to share my vacation, And the feast with our Bridegroom to share. CHORUS When I take my vacation in heaven, What a wonderful time that will be; Hearing concerts by the heavenly, And the face of my Savior I'll see; Sitting down by the banks of the river; 'Neath the shade of the ever green tree, I shall rest from my burdens forever, Won't you spend your vacation with me. Here on earth when we take our vacation, We return to our homes by and by; When I take my vacation in heaven, In those mansions of gold in the sky. I shall dwell with my Savior forever, With Him sit on His Heavenly Throne; All the days will be one, long vacation, When my Savior takes me to His home. CHORUS When I take my vacation in heaven, What a wonderful time that will be; Hearing concerts by the heavenly, And the face of my Savior I'll see; Sitting down by the banks of the river; 'Neath the shade of the ever green tree, I shall rest from my burdens forever, Won't you spend your vacation with me.
