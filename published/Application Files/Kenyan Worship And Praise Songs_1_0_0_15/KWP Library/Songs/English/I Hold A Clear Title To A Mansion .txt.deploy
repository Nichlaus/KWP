 I've heard people talk about heaven, And describe its beauties so rare, So one day I purchased a ticket, To a mansion in that city so fair It was given to me without money, But it cost my dear Saviour His life. He died on the cross without a murmur For me He paid the great price. CHORUS Oh I hold a clear title to a mansion That Jesus has gone to prepare Fire cannot touch it,thieves cannot harm it, And it never will need repair! The termites can't mar its foundation For on the Rock of Ages it stands I feel it is almost completed, And ready for me to move in. My deed was signed and recorded, The day Jesus saved me from sin And my name was engraved in gold letters, On the Lamb's Book of Life safe within, I'm an heir to a mansion in glory, Where from this I'll roll, I'm waiting for Jesus to call me, Then I'll lay down my cross and go home. CHORUS Oh I hold a clear title to a mansion That Jesus has gone to prepare Fire cannot touch it,thieves cannot harm it, And it never will need repair! The termites can't mar its foundation For on the Rock of Ages it stands I feel it is almost completed, And ready for me to move in.
