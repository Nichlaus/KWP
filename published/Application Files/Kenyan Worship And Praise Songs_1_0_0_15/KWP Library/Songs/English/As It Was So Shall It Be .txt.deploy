 It's been said we're living in a modern Sodom Just like what the Bible says it would be Things back as it started in the Bible, As it was, so shall it be. CHORUS As It was, so shall it be The wickedness of men has got to reign So we know that something Is about to happen As it was, so shall it be. In Malachi 4 God gave us the promise, And He came and fulfilled it in this time, In the midst of a Christ rejecting nation God called His bride,so shall it be. CHORUS As It was, so shall it be The wickedness of men has got to reign So we know that something Is about to happen As it was, so shall it be. In Noah's day just before the floods came, The morals of men had become so bad we know, Look around today in this land we're living, As it was, so shall it be. CHORUS As It was, so shall it be The wickedness of men has got to reign So we know that something Is about to happen As it was, so shall it be.
