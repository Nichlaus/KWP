 (Where could I go but to the Lord) It's so wonderful to know there's a place where you can go When you are all burdened down With the cares of this world, When it seems there's nothing real, That's the time when you should kneel Pray to God up in heaven,and tell Him how you feel. CHORUS It's so wonderful to know that He Is real Living in my soul His love I can feel With each step that I take I know am nearer home I know my trials will be over after a while. (When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there) When the trumpet of God shall sound oh where will you be found? Will your anchor be in Jesus And will your heart be free from sin? On that bright and cloudless morning With the saints I want to rise When the roll is called up yonder, I'll meet Him in the air. CHORUS It's so wonderful to know that He Is real Living in my soul His love I can feel With each step that I take I know am nearer home I know my trials will be over after a while. (When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)
