 Blessed be the Fountain of blood, To a world of sinners revealed; Blessed be the dear Son of God; Only by His stripes we are healed. Though I've wandered far from His fold, Bringing to my heart pain and woe, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow. CHORUS Whiter than the snow! Whiter than the snow! Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow. Father, I have wandered from Thee, Often has my heart gone astray; Crimson do my sins seem to me Water cannot wash them away. Jesus,to that Fountain of Thine, Leaning on Thy promise, I go; Cleanse me by Thy washing divine, And I shall be whiter than snow CHORUS Whiter than the snow! Whiter than the snow! Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.
