 I am on the gospel highway Pressing forward to the goal Where for me a rest remaineth In the home-land of the soul, Every hour I'm moving onward Not a moment to delay I am going home to glory In the good old fashioned-way. CHORUS In the good old fashioned-way In the good old fashioned-way I am going home to glory In the good old fashioned-way From the snares of sinful pleasure Here my feet are always free Tho' the way may be called narrow It is wide enough for me, It was wide enough for Daniel And for David in his day I am glad that I can follow In the good old fashioned-way. CHORUS In the good old fashioned-way In the good old fashioned-way I am going home to glory In the good old fashioned-way Many friends have gone before me They have laid their armour down With the pilgrims and the martyrs Have obtained a robe and crown On this road they fought their battles Shouting victory day by day I shall overcome and join them In the good old fashioned-way. CHORUS In the good old fashioned-way In the good old fashioned-way I am going home to glory In the good old fashioned-way Just a few more steps to follow Just a few more days to roam But the way grows more delightful As I'm drawing nearer home When the storms of life are over And the clouds have rolled away I shall find the gates of heaven In the good old fashioned-way. CHORUS In the good old fashioned-way In the good old fashioned-way I am going home to glory In the good old fashioned-way
