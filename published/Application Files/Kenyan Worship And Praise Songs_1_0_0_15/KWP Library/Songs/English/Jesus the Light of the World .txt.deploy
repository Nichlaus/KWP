 1 Hark! the herald angels sing, Jesus, the light of the world. Glory to the newborn King, Jesus, the light of the world. Refrain: Weâ€™ll walk in the light, beautiful light. Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright. O, shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus, the light of the world. 2 Joyful, all you nations, rise. Jesus, the light of the world. Join the triumph of the skies. Jesus, the light of the world. [Refrain] 3 Christ, by highest heaven adored; Jesus, the light of the world. Christ, the everlasting Lord; Jesus, the light of the world. [Refrain] 4 Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace! Jesus, the light of the world. Hail, the Sun of Righteousness! Jesus, the light of the world. [Refrain]
