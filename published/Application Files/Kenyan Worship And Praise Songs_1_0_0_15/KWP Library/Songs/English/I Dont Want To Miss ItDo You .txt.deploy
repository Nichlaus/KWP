 Some day my work will be over And my labour for Him will be through Then I'll climb yonder hill top to meet Him For I don't want to miss it, do you? CHORUS No I wouldn't miss it for nothing No matter what I have to go through Some day I'll lay down life's burden For I don't want to miss it do you? Sometimes I'm tired of my journey And I can't seem to find Him that's true But I know that He's waiting up yonder And I don't want to miss it do you? CHORUS No I wouldn't miss it for nothing No matter what I have to go through Some day I'll lay down life's burden For I don't want to miss it do you?
