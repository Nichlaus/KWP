 I had lived a life of sin and sorrow, Till I found the Lord, Jesus is my Saviour He died at Calvary; I'll follow Him with all my heart, I love Him, yes I do I can see a new bright future As from sin He set me free CHORUS Jesus keep me from all wrong, Jesus He was God's begotten Son Jesus the sweetest name I know, Jesus, He guides me as I go. One day we'll hear Him calling, We'll meet Him in the air; We shall all rise up to heaven For the marriage supper there For there there's peace forever Upon that golden shore, We'll reign with Christ in Heaven And praise Him ever more. CHORUS Jesus keep me from all wrong, Jesus He was God's begotten Son Jesus the sweetest name I know, Jesus, He guides me as I go.
