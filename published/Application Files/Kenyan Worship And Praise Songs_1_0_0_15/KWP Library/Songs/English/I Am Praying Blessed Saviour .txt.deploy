 I m praying, blessed saviour, To be more and more like thee; I am praying that Thy spirit Like a dove may rest on me CHORUS Thou who knowest all my weakness Thou who knowest all my care While I plead each precious promise Hear, Oh hear and answer prayr I am praying, blessed saviour For a faith so clear and bright That its eye will see Thy glory Through the deepest, darkest night CHORUS Thou who knowest all my weakness Thou who knowest all my care While I plead each precious promise Hear, Oh hear and answer prayr I am praying to be humbled By thy powr of grace divine To be clothed upon with meakness And to have no will but Thine CHORUS Thou who knowest all my weakness Thou who knowest all my care While I plead each precious promise Hear, Oh hear and answer prayr I am praying, blessed saviour And my constant prayr shall be For a perfect consecration That shall make me more like Thee CHORUS Thou who knowest all my weakness Thou who knowest all my care While I plead each precious promise Hear, Oh hear and answer prayer
