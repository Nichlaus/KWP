 If working and praying have any reward Then surely some morning I'll meet my Dear Lord, With God as my pilot,I'll climb the high ill, And if anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will. CHORUS Surely I will, surely I will If anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will, On top of mount Zion way up on the hill If anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will. With faith as my weapon,and hope as my stay Though baffles are all over, am well on my way. Though I may grow weary,am travelling still And if anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will. CHORUS Surely I will, surely I will If anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will, On top of mount Zion way up on the hill If anyone makes it all the way Lord, Surely I will.
