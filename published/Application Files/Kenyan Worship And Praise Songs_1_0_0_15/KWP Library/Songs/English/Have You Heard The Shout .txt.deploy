 CHORUS How many times must a man hear God's call Before he'll turn away from sins, How many times can you reject God's word Before He'll close the door on you? My friend do you realise God's spirit won't always strive God's spirit won't always strive with man. Have you heard the shout,as it went out loud and clear, Come out from among them my friends, Don't partake of their creeds The mysteries have been revealed, It's evening time,keep your lamps trimmed and clear. CHORUS How many times must a man hear God's call Before he'll turn away from sins, How many times can you reject God^s word Before He'll close the door on you? My friend do you realise God's spirit won't always strive God's spirit won't always strive with man. Through the mouth of the prophet, God has spoken once again, Repent repent of all of your sins Be baptized in Jesus Name For His power is still the same Just believe the promise given to you. CHORUS How many times must a man hear God's call Before he'll turn away from sins, How many times can you reject God^s word Before He'll close the door on you? My friend do you realise God's spirit won't always strive God's spirit won't always strive with man.
