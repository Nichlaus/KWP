 O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder. Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made; I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed. CHORUS Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When through the woods and forest glades I wander And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees; When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze. CHORUS Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! And when I think that God, His Son not sparing. Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin. CHORUS Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art! CHORUS Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
