 When Jacob met the Lord Upon that lonely night He wrestled there alone until the morning light He won a princely title To guard Him for the night CHORUS I want that kind of blessing I want yes I want That kind of blessing That saves and keeps And satisfies the soul I want yes I want, that full salvation Till the billows of heaven oer me roll. When Israel at last came to the promised land The Lord His blessings gave So full on every hand He fought their enemies from them They dwelt a happy land CHORUS I want that kind of blessing This is the day of grace The comforter has come We are the chosen bride The Lord is drawing nigh Hes waiting to be gracious The prayer of faith to hear And then Hell send the blessing
