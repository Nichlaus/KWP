 Lord you gave me a life without sorrow And a home where my problems are few, But should it all fall in pieces tomorrow, I just want to know that I have you. CHORUS Holding my hand Like you only can hold it Whispering peace,like no other can do I won't worry for fame and fortune If I only know that I have you. At last when this life is all over And Jordan chilly waters I view And no matter who is standing around me (Lord) I would like to know that I have you. CHORUS Holding my hand Like you only can hold it Whispering peace,like no other can do I won't worry for fame and fortune If I only know that I have you.
