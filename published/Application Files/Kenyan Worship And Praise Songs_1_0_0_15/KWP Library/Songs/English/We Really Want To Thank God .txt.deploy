 We really want to thank You, Lord, We really want to bless your Name, Hallelujah, Jesus is our King Thank You, Lord, for our lives together, To live and to move in the love of Christ; Tenderness which sets us free, To serve you with our lives. Praise God from whom all blessing flow, Praise Him all creatures here below, Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts: Praise Him for His Word divine. Thank You, Lord, for Your gifts to us, For life so rich beyond compare; The gift of your body here on earth, In which we sing and share.
