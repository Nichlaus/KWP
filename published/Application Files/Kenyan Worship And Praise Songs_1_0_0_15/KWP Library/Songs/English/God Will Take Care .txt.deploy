 Be not dismayed whatever betide God will take care of you Beneath His wings of love abide God will take care of you CHORUS God will take care of you, Through every day, Over all the way, He will take care of you, God will take care of you. Through days of toil when heart doth fail, God will take care of you. When dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you. CHORUS God will take care of you, Through every day, Over all the way, He will take care of you, God will take care of you. All you may need He will provide. God will take care of you. Nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you. CHORUS God will take care of you, Through every day, Over all the way, He will take care of you, God will take care of you. No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you. Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you. CHORUS God will take care of you, Through every day, Over all the way, He will take care of you, God will take care of you.
