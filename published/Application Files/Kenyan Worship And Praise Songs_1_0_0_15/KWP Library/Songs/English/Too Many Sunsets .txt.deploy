 Too many miles behind me Too many trials are past Too many tears help me to remember There's too much to gain to lose. CHORUS Too many sunsets lie behind the mountain Too many rivers my feet have walked through Too many treasures are waiting over yonder, (But) There's too much to gain to lose. I crossed the hot burning desert, Struggling the right roads to choose Somewhere up ahead there are cool clear waters And defeat is one word I'll never use CHORUS Too many sunsets lie behind the mountain Too many rivers my feet have walked through Too many treasures are waiting over yonder, (But) There's too much to gain to lose.
