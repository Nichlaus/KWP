 I've travelled many,many miles in this world here below Well I've seen the beauty and splendour that different times bring home Oh but I won't be satisfied living Here below My home is in heaven and I'm longing to go. CHORUS Just get on boat We are sailing home Just get on boat You know it won't be long Till we'll be crossing old Jordan's tide Just get on boat Well it may be tonight. Well I've got friends and loved ones Who have gone this trip I know And am longing to see them And to journey here below Cause I have made my preparation And I have got my reservation Now will you join me on this journey Are you ready to go... CHORUS Just get on boat We are sailing home Just get on boat You know it won't be long Till we'll be crossing old Jordan's tide Just get on boat Well it may be tonight.
