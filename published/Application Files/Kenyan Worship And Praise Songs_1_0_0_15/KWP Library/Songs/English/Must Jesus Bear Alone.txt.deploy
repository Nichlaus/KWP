Must Jesus bear the cross alone,And all the world go free?No, there's a cross for every one,And there's a cross for me.The consecrated cross I'll bear,Till death shall set me free,And then go home my crown to wear,For there's a crown for me.Upon the crystal pavement,downAt Jesus' pierced feet,With joy I'll cast my golden crown,And His dear name repeat.O precious cross! O glorious crown!O resurrection day!Ye angels from the stars come downAnd bear my soul away.
