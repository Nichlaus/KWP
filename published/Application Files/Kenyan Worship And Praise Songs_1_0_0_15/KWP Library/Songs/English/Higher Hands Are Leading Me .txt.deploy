 Though it seems I am oft unnoticed And lost in time and space God above is watching over me Though I cannot see His face. CHORUS Higher hands are leading me,are leading me Higher hands are leading me, I am not alone I know As I walk in this world below For higher hands are leading me. There's a great eternal purpose In the life of everyone And some day we'll know its meaning When our life on earth is done. CHORUS Higher hands are leading me,are leading me Higher hands are leading me, I am not alone I know As I walk in this world below For higher hands are leading me. So I face an unknown future Full of faith and unafraid And the faith I have through trusting For the world I would not trade. CHORUS Higher hands are leading me,are leading me Higher hands are leading me, I am not alone I know As I walk in this world below For higher hands are leading me.
