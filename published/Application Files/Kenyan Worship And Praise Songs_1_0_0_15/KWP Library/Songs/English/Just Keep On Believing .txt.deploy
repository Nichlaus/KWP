 Jesus is leading us on day by day, He walks besides us always, Giving us the victory as we overcome And He will be there when we lay our burdens down. CHORUS Just keep on remembering That God Is always near; Just keep on believing That His love will cast out fear, The sun waits to break through, And the clouds will roll away, If you have faith that there will be A better brighter day Just keep His word before you As you walk this narrow way, Don't let Satan get you down today, Stay by your post of duty, The race is almost run, Time is late now, It's the setting of the sun. CHORUS Just keep on remembering That God Is always near; Just keep on believing That His love will cast out fear, The sun waits to break through, And the clouds will roll away, If you have faith that there will be A better brighter day
