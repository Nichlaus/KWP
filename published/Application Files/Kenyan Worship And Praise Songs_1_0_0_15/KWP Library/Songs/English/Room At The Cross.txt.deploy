The cross upon which Jesus diedIs a shelter in which we can hide,And its grace so free is sufficient for me,And deep is its fountain; as wide as the sea.CHORUSThere's room at the cross for you.There's room at the cross for you.Though millions have come,there's still room for one,Yes, there's room at the cross for you.Though millions have found Him a friendAnd have turned from the sins they have sinned.The Saviour still waits to open the gates,And welcome a sinner before it's too late.CHORUSThere's room at the cross for you.There's room at the cross for you.Though millions have come,there's still room for one,Yes, there's room at the cross for you.The hand of my Saviour is strongAnd the love of my Saviour is long.Through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain,The blood flows from Calv'ry to cleanse every stain.CHORUSThere's room at the cross for you.There's room at the cross for you.Though millions have come,there's still room for one,Yes, there's room at the cross for you.
