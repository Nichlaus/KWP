 I don't wonna be free Lord,from the task that you gave me, I don't wonna be free Lord,from the load I am to share, This weight may be heavy,but its a privilege to bear it, I'm a prisoner of love now and I don't wonna be free. I'm a man born free,I may climb to the highest, As a man born free,I may climb to the depths But the choice is for me,just where I will wander But from your guiding hand Lord I don't wonna be free.
