 I've had many tears and sorrow, I've had questions for tomorrow, Many times I didn't know right from wrong; But in every situation, God gave me blessed consolation, That my trials only come to make me strong. CHORUS Through it all, through It all, I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust In God; Through It all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon His Word. I've been to a lot of places, And I've seen lots of faces, But there've been times that I felt so all alone; But in my lonely hours, Those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know that I am all His own. CHORUS Through it all, through It all, I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust In God; Through It all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon His Word. So I thank God for the mountains, And I thank Him for the valleys, And I thank Him for the storms He brought me through; For if I never had any problems, How could I know that God could solve them; How could I know what faith in God can do. CHORUS Through it all, through It all, I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust In God; Through It all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon His Word.
