 When John came preaching,preparing the way, For Jesus the heavenly King; For all who believed and trusted in His name, Would stand in God's kingdom and not be ashamed. CHORUS Let the Spirit descend,like a beautiful dove, As it did on Jesus that day He was baptized by John,in the river of Jordan, God's voice like thunder spoke This Is my Son. When Lazarus lay dead,in the grave four days, Martha sent for Jesus to come, Said Lazarus, come forth and he heard what He said Lazarus life flowed back,he arose from the dead. CHORUS Let the Spirit descend,like a beautiful dove, As it did on Jesus that day He was baptized by John,in the river of Jordan, God's voice like thunder spoke This Is my Son
