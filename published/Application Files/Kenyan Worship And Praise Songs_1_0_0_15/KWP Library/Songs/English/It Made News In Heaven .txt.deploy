 It didn't make the papers in this world, When I prayed through, It didn't seem to matter to all but just a few But in the gold streets of glory, Celebration burnt away And it made news in heaven When I got saved. CHORUS Angels were rejoicing, Hallelujah band When Jesus touched my life and changed Everyone In glory's reign knew my name was written down And it made news in heaven, When I got saved. Not long ago a beggar But now a child of the King This is the world that shrugged it's shoulder And it didn't mean a thing But it was for God's own approval That my spirit really prayed And it made news in heaven when I got saved. CHORUS Angels were rejoicing, Hallelujah band When Jesus touched my life and changed Everyone In glory's reign knew my name was written down And it made news in heaven, When I got saved.
