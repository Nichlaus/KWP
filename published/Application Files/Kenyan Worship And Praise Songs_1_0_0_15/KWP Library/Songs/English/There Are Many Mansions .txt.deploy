 Down the streets I see them building a mansion A lot of time is spent in building worldly fame Until I've learned to live in a mansion One that's built by the King of Kings. CHORUS I don't care for things on earth or treasure For life is too short for me to spend it chasing dreams But up yonder,we'll live on for ever, In a kingdom ruled by the King of Kings. In my Father's house,there are many mansions If it were not so I would have told you so, I'll be leaving and some day I will join Him In that city where the streets are as pure as gold. CHORUS I don't care for things on earth or treasure For life is too short for me to spend it chasing dreams But up yonder,we'll live on for ever, In a kingdom ruled by the King of Kings.
