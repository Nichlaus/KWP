 Along life's road I stumbled in the darkness My blinded eyes had caused my feet to roam, I met the Lord who spoke to me so sweetly, Come walk with me and now you will see home CHORUS Come walk with me The way Is strait and narrow Come walk with me, You cannot walk alone; For the road Is rough And there are many dangers Come walk with me And I will see you home. So now I walk with Christ My blessed Saviour I need not fear for I am not alone He guides me through this life With all it^s sorrows, And some day soon He^ll see me safely home. CHORUS Come walk with me The way is strait and narrow Come walk with me, You cannot walk alone; For the road Is rough And there are many dangers Come walk with me And I will see you home.
