 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, When the clouds unfold their wings of strife? When the strong tides lift,and the cables strain, Will your anchor shift, or firm remain? CHORUS We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fasten'd to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love. It is safely moor'd 'twill the storm withstand, For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand; And the cables, pass'd from His heart to mine, Can defy the blast, thro' strength divine, CHORUS We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fasten'd to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love. It will firmly hold in the straits of fear, When the breakers have told the reef is near; Tho' the tempest rave, and the wild winds blow, Not an angry wave shall our barque over - flow. CHORUS We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fasten'd to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love. It will surely hold in the floods of death, When the waters cold chill our latest breath; On the rising tide it can never fail, While our hopes abide within the veil! CHORUS We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fasten'd to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love.
