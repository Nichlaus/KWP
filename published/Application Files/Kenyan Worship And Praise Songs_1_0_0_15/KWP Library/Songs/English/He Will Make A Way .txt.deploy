 Looking for answers, you need a way out, Youve been trapped in that trial, full of sorrow and doubt, Youve seen a trickle of sunlight, but youve found no escape, Just hold on to His promises, He said that Hed make a way. CHORUS Hell make a way, in the middle of nowhere, When it seems no one really cares, Hes there by your side Hell make a way, when you feel satan closing in, Dont give up dont give in, Hell make a way right on time. Standing at the red sea, no place to go, Pharaohs army was closing in, theyd soon overthrow, Then right out of nowhere, came mighty strong hand, He drove back the waters, and made a way out again. CHORUS Hell make a way, in the middle of nowhere, When it seems no one really cares, Hes there by your side, Hell make a way, when you feel satan closing in, Dont give up dont give in, Hell make a way right on time.
