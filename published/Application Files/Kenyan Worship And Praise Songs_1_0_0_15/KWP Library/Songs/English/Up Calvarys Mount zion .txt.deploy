 Up calvary's mountain one dreadful morn, Walked Christ my Saviour,weary and worn Facing for sinners,death on the cross That He might save them,from endless loss. CHORUS Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer Seems now I see Him on calvary's tree Wounded and bleeding,for sinners pleading, Blind and unheeding, dying for me! Oh how I love Him Saviour and friend How can my praises ever find end, Through years unnumbered,on heaven's shore My tongue shall praise Him for ever more. CHORUS Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer Seems now I see Him on calvary's tree Wounded and bleeding,for sinners pleading, Blind and unheeding, dying for me!
