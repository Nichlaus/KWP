 If you see a man in sandals,please send Him down my way It might be my Master,He's coming back some day, If you see a man in white,that's like no one you've seen before Won't you let me know,that's the man I'm looking for. CHORUS And if you can remember, Ask Him what's His name, And if He tells you Jesus, Say we're glad you came Tell Him you know someoneThat still calls Him Lord Then send Him on to me, That's the man I'm looking for. If you see a man that shines with a love flow on His face; Turn Him down my street,so He can find my place, And if His hands are scarred,please don't shut the door Just send Him on to me,that's the man I'm looking for. CHORUS And if you can remember, Ask Him what's His name, And if He tells you Jesus, Say we're glad you came Tell Him you know someoneThat still calls Him Lord Then send Him on to me, That's the man I'm looking for.
