 I've found new a way of praying, I've started praying the Word, Just believing what God said, And not what I've always heard. Now my feelings would fool me Lead me wrong every time Reasonings deceive me So am not trusting my mind. CHORUS (But) Well I'm casting down my imaginations Every high thing that exalted itself Against the knowledge of God Bringing into captivity Every thought to the obedience of Christ. I've found a new way of feeling I've started feeling by faith I didn't get it by thinking I only got it by grace When my mind tries to tell me The Word of God isn't true I don't let devil deceive me I'll tell you just what I do. CHORUS (But) Well I'm casting down my imaginations Every high thing that exalted itself Against the knowledge of God Bringing into captivity Every thought to the obedience of Christ.
