 The other day I held my head and cried in shame; I asked the Lord if there's someone that I could show the way When I think of the loved ones who live their live in vain, I pray Dear Lord may I not be the one that is to blame. CHORUS May my life down here be a stepping stone for them, May they not see me but Christ living in me Help me spend more time on my knees and pray for them, Before you close the door like you did in Noah's time. It's getting late soon time will be no more Help me walk in the light of the prophet of Malachi 4 Not to rely on others but do what the Word says do Before you call for me,let me live my life for you. CHORUS May my life down here be a stepping stone for them, May they not see me but Christ living in me Help me spend more time on my kness and pray for them, Before you close the door like you did in Noah's time.
