My heavenly home is bright and fair,I feel like travelling on,Nor pain, nor death can enter there,I feel like travelling on.CHORUSYes, I feel like travelling on,I feel like travelling on,My heavenly home is bright and fair,I feel like travelling on.Its glittering towers the sun outshine,I feel like travelling on,That heavenly mansion shall be mine,I feel like travelling on.CHORUSYes, I feel like travelling on,I feel like travelling on,My heavenly home is bright and fair,I feel like travelling on.Let others seek a home below,I feel like travelling on,Which flames devour, or waves o'erflow,I feel like travelling on.CHORUSYes, I feel like travelling on,I feel like travelling on,My heavenly home is bright and fair,I feel like travelling on.The Lord has been so good to me,I feel like travelling on,Until that blessed home I see,I feel like travelling on.CHORUSYes, I feel like travelling on,I feel like travelling on,My heavenly home is bright and fair,I feel like travelling on.
