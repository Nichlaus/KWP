 I can hear my Saviour calling, I can hear my Saviour calling, I can hear my Saviour calling, Take thy cross, and follow, follow Me. CHORUS Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. CHORUS Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. I'll go with Him through the judgement, I'll go with Him through the judgement, I'll go with Him through the judgement, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. CHORUS Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, And go with me, with me all the way.
