 My dear friend this sinful world is lost and dying Every Christian's heart is burdened down with care Tell me are you doing all you can for Jesus CHORUS Take me and break me Mould me and make me I want to do all thy will Oh Lord He paid the price The sacrifice with His blood at Calvary He stood alone in Pilates judgement hall He took the cross, paid the cost For my soul that was lost I want to do thy will Oh Lord CHORUS Take me and break me Mould me and make me I want to do all thy will Oh Lord
