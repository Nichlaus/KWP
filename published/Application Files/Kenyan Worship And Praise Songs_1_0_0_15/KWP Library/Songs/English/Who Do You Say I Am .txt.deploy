 Whenever God's moving or reveals anything Many people just ridicule and scoff at the thing But there's always some faithful the true seed of God That will cling to God's promise and walk on in love. CHORUS Some called Him a devil Some called Him God some called Him a fortune teller or Beelzebub Some called it psychology But in God we can trust To fulfil all the scriptures That are promised for us. In the days of Jesus the son of God When He asked them who people said that He was, Some say you are Elias,Jeremiah or John But then He asked his disciples Who do you say I am? CHORUS Some called Him a devil Some called Him God some called Him a fortune teller or Beelzebub Some called it psychology But in God we can trust To fulfil all the scriptures That are promised for us. We are promised in the end time that Elias must come To reveal the mysteries before Jesus can come Some will call him a devil While some think he is god But there's some that's rejoicing for the True Word of God. CHORUS Some called Him a devil Some called Him God some called Him a fortune teller or Beelzebub Some called it psychology But in God we can trust To fulfil all the scriptures That are promised for us.
