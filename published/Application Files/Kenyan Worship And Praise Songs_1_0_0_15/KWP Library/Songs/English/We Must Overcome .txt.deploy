 How could God complete His work In you if youre not living a life that is really true? We must understand what Weve been called to This will take real sincerity To bring our lifes condition for eternity Where our lives will be transformed into that of Jesus Christ If we dont overcome How could we be resurrected? We must understand what weve been called unto To come to this place we must surrender Our lives completely to Him and walk And live with the understanding of who we are Sons and daughters of the mighty conqueror We must overcome Gentile warriors We must overcome! We must overcome! Dont be manipulated by our enemy If you can really understand Your true identity Then you will have constant victory As a child of God You have full authority Its the power in the genes He placed in you and me This was truly revealed Through the opening Of the seventh seal If we dont overcome How could we be resurrected? We must understand what weve been called unto To come to this place we must surrender Our lives completely to Him and walk And live with the understanding of who we are Sons and daughters of the mighty conqueror We must overcome Gentile warriors We must overcome! We must overcome!
