 A few more years shall roll A few more seasons come, And we shall be with those that rest Asleep within the tomb. Then,O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood, And take my sins away. A few more suns shall set Over these dark hills of time, And we shall be where suns are not - A far serener clime. Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that bright day; Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood And take my sins away. A few more storms shall beat On this wild rocky shore, And we shall be where tempests cease, And surges swell no more. Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that calm day; Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood, And take my sins way. A few more struggles here, A few more partings over, A few more toils, a few more tears, And we shall weep no more. Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that blest day; Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood, And take my sins away. 'Tis but a little while And He shall come again, Who died that we might live-who lives That we with Him may reign: Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that glad day; Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood, And take my sins away.
