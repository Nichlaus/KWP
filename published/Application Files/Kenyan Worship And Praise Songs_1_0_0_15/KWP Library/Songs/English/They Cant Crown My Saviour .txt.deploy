 But there's one thing am sure ThatI know they can't do They can't crown my saviour Untill I get there. I may not have fortune,I may net have fame But when He opens His Book,He will find my name, And perhaps my neighbour,will meet me there, But they can't crown my Jesus,until I get there. On the coronation day, in that land far away The marriage supper with the angels we will share But there's one thing am sure That I know they can't do, They can't crown my Saviour until I get there. You may be very rich,or you may be poor You may have to eat at the rich man's door But remember some day,heavens glory we'll share But they can't crown Jesus, until I get there.
