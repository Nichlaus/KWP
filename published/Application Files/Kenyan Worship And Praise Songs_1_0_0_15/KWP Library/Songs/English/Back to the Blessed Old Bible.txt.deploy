Back to the blessed old Bible,Back to the city of God;Back to the oneness of heaven,Back where the faithful have trod.Back from the land of confusion,Passing the wrecks and the creeds;Back to the light of the morning,Jesus our Captain leads.[Refrain]Back to the blessed old Bible,Back to the light of its word;Be on our banners forever:“Holiness unto the Lord.”Back to the blessed old Bible,Saints of Jehovah, rejoice;Jesus is calling His peopleBack to the land of their choice.Often our fathers have sought itWhile we in Babel abode,Now we have found the fair city-Church of the living God.Back to the blessed old Bible,Leaving confusion and strife;Fleeing from Babel to Zion,Back to the joy of our life.Over the mountains we wandered,Looking in vain for the right;Now in the evening we’ve found it:Truth of the gospel light.Back to the blessed old Bible,Back at the Master’s call,Back to the words of our Savior,Loving, obeying them all.Never in sects to be scattered,Never again to do wrong;Unity, holiness, heaven,Ever shall be our song.
