 My hands cannot do the things you do, My hands only long to do your will So I lift them upto you,as a living sacrifice, I will never fear for I'm in gentle hands. Gentle hands holding on to me Gentle hands guiding me so carefully, Though they lead me down thro' paths I don't always understand I will never fear for I'm in gentle hands.
