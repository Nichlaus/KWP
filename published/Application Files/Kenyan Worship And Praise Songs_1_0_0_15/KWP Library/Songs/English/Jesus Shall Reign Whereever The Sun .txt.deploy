 Jesus shall reign wherever the sun Doth his successive journeys run: His kingdom stretch from shore to Shore Till moons shall wax and wane no more For Him shall endless prayer be made, And princes throng to crown His head: His name sweet perfume shall rise With every morning sacrifice. People and realms of every tongue Dwell on His love with sweetest song, And infant voices shall proclaim Their early blessings on His Name. Blessings abound wherever He reigns; The prisoner leaps to lose his chains, The weary find eternal rest, And all the Sons of want are blest. Let every creature rise and bring Peculiar honours to our King: Angels, descend with songs again And, earth, repeat the loud Amen.
