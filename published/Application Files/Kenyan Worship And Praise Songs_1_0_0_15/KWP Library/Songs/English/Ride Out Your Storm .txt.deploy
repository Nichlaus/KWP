 You've been in the storm, It seems like forever; Your night of confusion has been all so long, Your ship has lost anchor and the tide has got you drifting If you hold on to Jesus, He'll help you ride out your storm. CHORUS Ride out your storm, God's right there with you You may not see Him But you're never alone; You're hurting now, But morning Is coming; Just hold on to Jesus and Ride our your storm. Remember His promise, He said I'll never forsake you Though the waters be raging; They will do you no harm, Don't give up your battle; Your answer is coming; Just hold on to Jesus and ride out your storm. CHORUS Ride out your storm, God's right there with you You may not see Him But you're never alone; You're hurting now, But morning Is coming; Just hold on to Jesus and Ride our your storm.
