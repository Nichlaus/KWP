 We are climbing Jacob's ladder, We are climbing Jacob's ladder, We are climbing Jacob's ladder, Soldiers of the Cross. Rise, shine give God the glory, Rise, shine give God the glory, Rise, shine give God the glory, Soldiers of the Cross. Every rung goes higher and higher, Every rung goes higher and higher, Every rung goes higher and higher, Soldiers of the Cross. If you love Him, why not serve Him? If you love Him, why not serve Him? If you love Him why not serve Him? Soldiers of the Cross.
