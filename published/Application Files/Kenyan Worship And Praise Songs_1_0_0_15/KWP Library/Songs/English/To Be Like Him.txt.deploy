From Bethlehem's manger came forth a Stranger.On earth I long to be like Him;My faithful Saviour, how rich His favor!On earth I long to be like Him.CHORUSTo be like Jesus, to be like Jesus,On earth I long to be like Him;All thru life's journey from earth to gloryI only ask to be like Him.Serene and holy, obedient, lowly,On earth I long to be like Him.By grace forgiven, an heir of heaven,On earth I long to be like Him.CHORUSTo be like Jesus, to be like Jesus,On earth I long to be like Him;All thru life's journey from earth to gloryI only ask to be like Him.
