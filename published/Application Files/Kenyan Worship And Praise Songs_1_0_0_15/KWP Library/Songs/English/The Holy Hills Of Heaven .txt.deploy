 The Holy hills of heaven call me, Mansions bright across the sea, Where loved ones wait and crowns are given, And the hills of home keep calling me. CHORUS This house of flesh is but a prison, Bars of bones hold my soul But the doors of clay are gonna burst wide open When the angel sets my spirit free I'll take my flight,like a mighty eagle For the hills of home keep calling me. I see loved ones over yonder, Tears are gone and their hearts are free And from the throne, my Saviour beckons And the hills of home keep calling me. CHORUS This house of flesh is but a prison, Bars of bones hold my soul But the doors of clay are gonna burst wide open When the angel sets my spirit free I'll take my flight,like a mighty eagle For the hills of home keep calling me.
