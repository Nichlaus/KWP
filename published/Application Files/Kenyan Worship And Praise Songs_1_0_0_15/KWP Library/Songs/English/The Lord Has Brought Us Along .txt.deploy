 Now I want you to picture,Jesus on the cross The nails on His hands and on His feet, The thorns on His head, Have you ever asked the question suppose it was you All the great pains on the cross to bear, Just to save another man. CHORUS (Oh) the Lord has brought us a long way, A long way from sin And we have been appointed servants of the Lord We have come a long way,a long way from sin Because we have a message from the Lord. Now I want to tell you from the Word of God, The answer to the question that is in your mind The reason that Jesus died was to save us from sin The great pain He had to bear just to save you and me. CHORUS (Oh) the Lord has brought us a long way, A long way from sin And we have been appointed servants of the Lord We have come a long way,a long way from sin Because we have a message from the Lord.
