 In this world I've tried most everything, And I'm happy now to say There is nothing like religion In the good old-fashioned way; I am walking in the old-time way, And I want the world to know That I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. CHORUS I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. There's nothing like an old-time Christian With a Christian love to show; I'm walking in the grand old highway, And I'm telling everywhere I go, That I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. There are many things I'd like to be As my journey I pursue, I have longed to be a leader Like a mortal man would do; I would like to be a millionaire, With a million to bestow, But I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. CHORUS I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. There's nothing like an old-time Christian With a Christian love to show; I'm walking in the grand old highway, And I'm telling everywhere I go, That I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. All the world is bright since I got right. Now I sing and pray and shout, All my burdens have been lifted Since the Saviour brought me out; I will tell the world both far and near As I travel here below. That I'd rather be an oldtime Christian Than anything I know. CHORUS I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know. There's nothing like an old-time Christian With a Christian love to show; I'm walking in the grand old highway, And I'm telling everywhere I go, That I'd rather be an old-time Christian Than anything I know.
