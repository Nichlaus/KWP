 I will meet you in the morning, by the bright river side, When all sorrow has drifted away; I'll be standing at the portals, when the gates open wide, At the close of life's long, dreary day. CHORUS I'll meet you in the morning with a How do you do, And we'll sit down by the river and with rapture auld acquaintance renew, You'll know me in the morning, by the smiles that I wear, When I meet you in the morning, in the city that is built foursquare. I will meet you in the morning, in the sweet by and by, And exchange the old cross for a crown; There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die, In that land, ever the sun goeth down. CHORUS I'll meet you in the morning with a How do you do, And we'll sit down by the river and with rapture auld acquaintance renew, You'll know me in the morning, by the smiles that I wear, When I meet you in the morning, in the city that is built foursquare. I will meet you in the morning, at the end of the way, On the streets of that city of gold; Where we all can be together and be happy for aye, While the years and the ages shall roll. CHORUS I'll meet you in the morning with a How do you do, And we'll sit down by the river and with rapture auld acquaintance renew, You'll know me in the morning, by the smiles that I wear, When I meet you in the morning, in the city that is built foursquare.
