 As you travel along this pilgrim Way There are heartaches and burdens to bear, But with a vision of Jesus and heaven in view Your cross is much lighter to bear. CHORUS Don't lose your vision of Jesus, Keep your eyes ever on Him, Many Friends and dear loved ones have lost their way, They have lost their vision of Him. I remember the time,I remember the place, Where Jesus so sweetly came in, How He took all my burdens I carried so long, When I first caught a vision of Him. CHORUS Don't lose your vision of Jesus, Keep your eyes ever on Him, Many Friends and dear loved ones have lost their way, They have lost their vision of Him.
