 Jesus said, it is expedient for me to go away Then all send you another comforter to guide you from day to day So they tarried in Jerusalem for power would come from high That same spirit that they received will in my heart abide. CHORUS I can feel the Holy Spirit Oh dwelling deep within Well sometimes it feels so gentle And sometimes like a mighty rushing wind, But that same Spirit that raised Jesus up from the dead and from the grave, It shall raise, this sore body up and take me home some day. Oh they laid Him in an empty tomb And they rolled the old stone at the door; They put soldiers, there to guard Him,you know They thought they'd run away with the Lord, But on the third day, the stone was rolled away And He came forth from the grave That same Spirit that raised Jesus up will take me home some day. CHORUS I can feel the Holy Spirit Oh dwelling deep within Well sometimes it feels so gentle And sometimes like a mighty rushing wind, But that same Spirit that raised Jesus up from the dead and from the grave, It shall raise, this sore body up and take me home some day.
