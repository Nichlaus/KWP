 Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth or song As the burdens press, and the cares distress And the way grows weary and long? CHORUS Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares His heart is touched with my grief When the days are weary , the long nights dreary I know my saviour cares Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear? As the daylight fades into deep night shades Does He care enough to be near? CHORUS Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares His heart is touched with my grief When the days are weary , the long nights dreary I know my saviour cares Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed To resist some temptation strong When for my deep grief there is no relief Though my tears flow all the night long? CHORUS Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares His heart is touched with my grief When the days are weary , the long nights dreary I know my saviour cares Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye To the dearest on earth to me And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks Is it to Him? Does He care? CHORUS Oh yes, He cares, I know He cares His heart is touched with my grief When the days are weary , the long nights dreary I know my saviour cares
