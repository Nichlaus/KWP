 When God delivered Israel from bondage that day By a prophet a pillar of fire to guide them on their way But true to mans nature and just like today They looked back towards Egypt and in their heart fell away. CHORUS As for me and my house well serve the Lord Well walk in His footsteps Believe only His word Well raise up our children in the fear of the Lord And therell arise not a generation that knows not the Lord When Joshua led them over to that promised land They were happy and rejoicing Enemies fell at their hands But when Joshuas days were ended And he lay down his sword There arose a generation that knew not the Lord CHORUS As for me and my house well serve the Lord Well walk in His footsteps Believe only His word Well raise up our children in the fear of the Lord And therell arise not a generation that knows not the Lord Let us fight the good fight from day to day And like Moses said to Pharoah Were off going out to pray A lamb for a house with the blood all applied We will claim our whole families to march by our side CHORUS As for me and my house well serve the Lord Well walk in His footsteps Believe only His word Well raise up our children in the fear of the Lord And therell arise not a generation that knows not the Lord
