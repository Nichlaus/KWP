 There's a holy and beautiful city, Whose builder and ruler is God. John saw it descending from heaven When Patmos, in exile, he trod; Its high,massive wall is of jasper, The city itself is pure gold; And when my frail tent here is folded, Mine eyes shall its glory behold. CHORUS In that bright city, pearly white city, I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown; Now I am watching, waiting and longing, For the white city John saw coming down. No sin is allowed in that city, And nothing defiling nor mean; No pain and no sickness can enter, No crape on the doorknob is seen; Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten, No tempter is there to annoy; No parting words ever are spoken, There's nothing to hurt and destroy. CHORUS In that bright city, pearly white city, I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown; Now I am watching, waiting and longing, For the white city John saw coming down. No heartaches are known in that city, No tears ever moisten the eye, There's no disappointment in heaven, No envy and strife in the sky; The saints are all sanctified wholly, They live in sweet harmony there; My heart is now set on that city, And some day its blessings I'll share. CHORUS In that bright city, pearly white city, I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown; Now I am watching, waiting and longing, For the white city John saw coming down. My loved ones are gathering yonder, My friends, too, are passing away; And soon I shall join their bright number, They're safe now in glory with Jesus, Their trials and battles are past; They overcome sin and the tempter, They've reached that fair city at last. CHORUS In that bright city, pearly white city, I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown; Now I am watching, waiting and longing, For the white city John saw coming down.
