 Life is like a mountain railroad With an engineer thats brave We must make the run successful From the cradle to the grave Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels, never falter, never quail Keep your hand upon the throttle And your eye upon the rail CHORUS Blessed saviour thou wilt guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forever more You will roll up the grades of trial You will cross the bridge of strife See that Christ is your conductor On this lighting train of life Always mindful of obstruction Do your duty, never fail Keep your hand upon the throttle And your eye upon the rail CHORUS Blessed saviour thou wilt guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forever more You will often find obstruction Look for storms of wind and rains On a hill, or curve, or trestle, they will almost ditch your train Put you trust alone in Jesus Never falter, never fail Keep your hand upon the throttle And your eye upon the rail CHORUS Blessed saviour thou wilt guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forever more As you roll upon the trestle Spanning Jordan's swelling tide There you'll meet the superintendent God the father, God he son With the hearty , joyous, plaudit, weary pilgrim, welcome home! Keep your hand upon the throttle And your eye upon the rail CHORUS Blessed saviour thou wilt guide us Till we reach that blissful shore Where the angels wait to join us In thy praise forever more
