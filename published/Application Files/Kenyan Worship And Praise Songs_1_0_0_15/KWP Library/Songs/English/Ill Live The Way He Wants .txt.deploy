 CHORUS I'm gonna live the way He wants me to live I'm gonna give until there's just no more to give I'm gonna love, love till there's just no more love, I could never ever out love the Lord. Many times in loving and giving brought pain, And I promised I'd never let it happen again And I found out that loving was worth all there is And rather give in,to losing my way. CHORUS I'm gonna live the way He wants me to live I'm gonna give until there's just no more to give I'm gonna love, love till there's just no more love, I could never ever out love the Lord. He showed us that only through dying we live, And He gave when it seemed there was nothing to give He loved when loving brought heartache and pain And He forgave,from an old rugged cross. CHORUS I'm gonna live the way He wants me to live I'm gonna give until there's just no more to give I'm gonna love, love till there's just no more love, I could never ever out love the Lord.
