 Some glad morning when this life is over I'll fly away To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away. CHORUS I'll fly away (Oh glory), I'll fly away I'll be changed hallelujah by and by I'll fly away. When the shadows of this life are over I'll fly away Like a bird from prison bars has flown I'll fly away. CHORUS I'll fly away (Oh glory), I'll fly away I'll be changed hallelujah by and by I'll fly away. Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away To a land where joys will never end I'll fly away. CHORUS I'll fly away (Oh glory), I'll fly away I'll be changed hallelujah by and by I'll fly away.
