 Living under the Lambs shed blood As the star shines through the way I will take my stand with Jesus my Lord, Clinging to the Holy Word, Yielding all my life to Jesus, I will live under the blood. CHORUS Have you been restored Back to the holy faith Hear the voice,the bridegroom cometh, Have you seen the evening light. Great rivers of joy in men And tears flow in my eyes The battle of flesh and spirit in me Treading on forsaken path It's by faith I'll trail to glory, Praying in the Holy Ghost. CHORUS  Have you been restored  Back to the holy faith  Hear the voice,the bridegroom cometh,  Have you seen the evening light.  I'll yield my all to Christ  My sword His Holy Word  And my ladder and ark to float up above  May He help me to obey  Built upon apostles and prophets  Jesus Christ the corner stone.  CHORUS  Have you been restored  Back to the holy faith  Hear the voice,the bridegroom cometh,  Have you seen the evening light.  When He comes to take me home  I will sing the triumph song  A home beyond my words to describe  The Son of David reigning in the everlasting Kingdom  We shall never part again.  CHORUS  Have you been restored  Back to the holy faith  Hear the voice,the bridegroom cometh,  Have you seen the evening light.
