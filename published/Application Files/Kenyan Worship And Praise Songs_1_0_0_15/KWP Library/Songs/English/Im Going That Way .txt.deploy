 I've heard of a land of joy and peace and wonderful light, A beautiful place of mansions fair and skies ever bright, I know I'll be near the Saviour dear, for ever to stay, And having been saved by grace divine, I'm going that way. CHORUS I'm going that way, I'm going that way, And Jesus the Saviour I adore Is with me each day, I'm clinging to Him and never to stray, Just singing His praises all day long, I'm going that way. The glorious news I'll tell and sing as onward I go, For those who're still astray in sin,my Saviour may know, I want them to sing His praises above some beautiful day, Oh glory to Him who died for me I'm going that way. CHORUS I'm going that way, I'm going that way, And Jesus the Saviour I adore Is with me each day, I'm clinging to Him and never to stray, Just singing His praises all day long, I'm going that way. I know I shall meet Him at the gate,when trials are past, I know I shall meet Him face to face,in glory at last, And now I believe that when we meet,well done He'll say, For trusting His souls redeeming Blood, I'm going that way. CHORUS I'm going that way, I'm going that way, And Jesus the Saviour I adore Is with me each day, I'm clinging to Him and never to stray, Just singing His praises all day long, I'm going that way.
