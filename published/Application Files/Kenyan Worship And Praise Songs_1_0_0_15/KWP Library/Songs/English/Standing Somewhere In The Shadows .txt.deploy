 Are there crosses too heavy to carry? And burdens too heavy to bear? Are there heartaches and tears and anguish And no one who sees and cares CHORUS Standing somewhere in the shadows Youll find Jesus Hes a friend who always Cares and understands Standing somewhere in the shadows youll find Him And youll know Him by the nail prints in His hands Are there shadows of deep disappointment? And trust that has proven untrue? As the darkness of night settles round you As your hope and your faith waver through? CHORUS Standing somewhere in the shadows Youll find Jesus Hes a friend who always Cares and understands Standing somewhere in the shadows youll find Him And youll know Him by the nail prints in His hands
