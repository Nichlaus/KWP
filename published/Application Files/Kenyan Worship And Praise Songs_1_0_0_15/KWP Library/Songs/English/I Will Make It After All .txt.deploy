 Trials here are sometimes many, And often times my feet grow weary Till it seems I almost stumble and fall But the tender hand that leads me, Is the one that keeps me steady And I know that I will make it,after all. CHORUS After all this life is over And my burdens have been lifted And I stand upon the mountain top so tall Looking over In that city That the Saviour is preparing Gives me faith that I will make it,after all. By myself I cannot make it, But I know He's there to help me He will hear my prayer if on Him I will call Keep on trusting and believing, Are the words I hear Him whisper Just a few more days to labour,after all. CHORUS After all this life is over And my burdens have been lifted And I stand upon the mountain top so tall Looking over In that city That the Saviour is preparing Gives me faith that I will make it,after all.
