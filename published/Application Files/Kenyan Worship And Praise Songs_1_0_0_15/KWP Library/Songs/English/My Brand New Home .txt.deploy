 If you're awed by the world and all its beauty, Many stately mansions daily you may see, But without great wealth I know I'll never own one, And you won't either if you're no more rich than me. But if your soul will look beyond what man is building, You will see what earthly mortals cannot see. Far on the other side of Jordan there's construction, On a mansion being built just for me CHORUS Just wait till you see,my brand new home. Wait till you see it's beauty rare nothing down here can compare. Just wait you'll see my brand new home. My heavenly Father's building there Fifteen hundrend miles foursquare, Just wait you'll see,my brand new home. In the thousand - years of peace I'll build my own home. Everything I've ever wanted I'll have there. All the streams,the trees,the rivers,and the mountains, The animals,the eagles sailing through the air Oh!but compared to that one that God is building The earth a - fire from God Will cleanse her from sin, When my home comes down. CHORUS Just wait till you see,my brand new home. Wait till you see it's beauty rare nothing down here can compare. Just wait you'll see my brand new home. My heavenly Father's building there, Fifteen hundrend miles foursquare, Just wait you'll see,my brand new home.
