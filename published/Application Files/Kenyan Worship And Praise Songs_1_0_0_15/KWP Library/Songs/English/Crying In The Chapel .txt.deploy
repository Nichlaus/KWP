 You saw me crying in the chapel The tears I shed were tears of joy I know the meaning of contentment Now I am happy with the Lord Just a plain and simple chapel There humble people go to pray I know the Lord will me stronger As I feed upon His word I^ve searched and I've searched But I couldnt find No way on earth To gain peace of mind Now Im happy in the chapel Where people are of one accord Yes, we gather in chapel Just to sing and praise the Lord Youll search and youll search But youll never find No way on earth To gain peace of mind Take your troubles to the chapel Get down on your knees and pray Then your burdens will be lighter And youll surely find the way
