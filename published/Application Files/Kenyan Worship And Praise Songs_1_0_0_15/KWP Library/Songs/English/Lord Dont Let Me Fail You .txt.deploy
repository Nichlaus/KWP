 CHORUS Lord don't let me fail you I wonna be in your bride When my way grows dark Keep me by your side When my faith grows weak Always let me see Something in my life Lord You have done for me. We follow on our way We are all like sheep Lord Who've gone astray Christ is our Saviour He'll never forsake His own In this age of sin I know He's gonna lead me home. CHORUS Lord don't let me fail you I wonna be in your bride When my way grows dark Keep me by your side When my faith grows weak Always let me see Something in my life Lord You have done for me. Sometimes the way is weary I am burdened down with tears It seems I have no friends to keep me here Then I hear your voice Saying come I am your God I will take you through. CHORUS Lord don't let me fail you I wonna be in your bride When my way grows dark Keep me by your side When my faith grows weak Always let me see Something in my life Lord You have done for me.
