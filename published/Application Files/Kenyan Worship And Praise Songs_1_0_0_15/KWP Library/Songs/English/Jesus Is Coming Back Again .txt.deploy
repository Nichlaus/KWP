 Jesus died on the cross at Calvary, He shed His own Blood for you and for me, But He arose again on that Easter morn, So repent everyone and in Christ be reborn. CHORUS Jesus Is coming back to earth again, He's coming for His Bride to take them up with Him, Jesus is coming back to earth again, As soon as the last one has entered therein. The end-time Message came forth a while ago, He brought back the Word and things we ought to know, In Malachi 4 it tells of a prophet to come, He came and delivered the Word to everyone. CHORUS Jesus Is coming back to earth again, He's coming for His Bride to take them up with Him, Jesus is coming back to earth again, As soon as the last one has entered therein.
