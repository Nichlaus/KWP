 Alas! And did my Saviour bleed, And did my Sovereign die? Would He devote that sacred head For such a worm as I? CHORUS At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day! Was it for crimes that I have done, He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity, grace unknown, And love beyond degree! CHORUS At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day! Well might the sun in darkness hide, And shut his glories in. When Christ, the mighty Maker, died For man, the creature's sin. CHORUS At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day! But drops of grief can ne'er repay The debt of love I owe; Here, Lord, I give myself away, 'Tis all that I can do! CHORUS At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day!
