 Why did you choose to die on the cross? Why did you choose to die on that day? Why did you choose to be buried in the grave? Why did you choose to die? Why did you choose the crown on that day? Why did you choose to be stoned and mocked? Why did you choose to be beaten and mistreated? Why did you choose to die? Why did you love undeserving as I am? Why did you care so much for me? Why did you leave that heaven for me? Why did you choose to die?
