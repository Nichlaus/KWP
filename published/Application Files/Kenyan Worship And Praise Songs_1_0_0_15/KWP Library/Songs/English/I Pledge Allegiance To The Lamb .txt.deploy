 I've heard how Christians long ago, Were brought before a tyrant's throne, That he would save their lives If they would renounce The Name of Christ But one by one they chose to die For the Son of God they would not deny But the great angelic choir sings I can almost hear their voices ring. CHORUS I pledge allegiance to the Lamb With all my strength,with all I am I will seek to honour His commands I pledge allegience to... The Lamb. Now the years have come, And the years have gone And the cause of Jesus still goes on Now a time has come to count the cost To reject this world,and to embrace own Cross And on by one let us live our lives For the one who died to give us life Till the trumpet sounds on the final day Let us proudly stand and boldly say.... CHORUS I pledge allegiance to the Lamb With all my strength,with all I am I will seek to honour His commands I pledge allegience to... The Lamb. To the Lamb of God ... who bore pain Who took my place who wore my shame I will seek to honour His commands I have pledged allegience to the Lamb. CHORUS I pledge allegiance to the Lamb With all my strength,with all I am I will seek to honour His commands I pledge allegience to... The Lamb.
