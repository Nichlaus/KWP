 The things that I love and hold dear to my heart, Are just borrowed, they're not mine at all; Jesus only lets me use them to brighten my life, So remind me, remind me, dear Lord. CHORUS Roll back the curtain of memory now and then, Show me where you brought me from And where I could have been Remember, I'm human, and human forgets So remind me, remind me dear Lord. Nothing good have I done to deserve Gods own Son I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands. Yet He chose the road to calv'ry to die in my stead Why He loved me I can't understand. CHORUS Roll back the curtain of memory now and then, Show me where you brought me from And where I could have been Remember, I'm human, and human forgets So remind me, remind me dear Lord.
