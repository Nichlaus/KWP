 Am singing for my Lord,everywhere I go Singing of His wondrous love that the world may know, How He saved a wretch like me by His death at calvary Am singing for my Lord, everywhere I go. Am singing for the lost just because I know Jesus Christ whose precious blood washes white as snow If my song to Him can bring one lost soul I'll gladly sing, Am singing for my Lord everywhere I go. Am singing for the saints,as they journey home Soon they'll reach that better land never more to roam Soon I'll join with them and sing,praises to my God and King Am singing for my Lord,everywhere I go. Am singing though sometimes,heavy with the load For this world is not my friend to the grace of God Yet I'll sing the whole day long,praises to my God and King Am singing for my Lord,everywhere I go.
