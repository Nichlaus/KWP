 The Son of God, they called Him Jesus, He came to save, heal and forgive, He lived and died to buy my pardon, An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives. CHORUS Because He lives I can face tomorrow, Because He lives all fear is gone, Because I know He holds the future, And life Is worth, the living just because He lives. The world today has nailed my Jesus, Upon a cross, a cross of shame, This second death has given victory, The Bride now knows He had to die that she could live. CHORUS Because He lives I can face tomorrow, Because He lives all fear is gone, Because I know He holds the future, And life Is worth, the living just because He lives. I know today that He is living, The Word of God is manifest, The Bride of Christ has seen His Body, The opening up of the Seven Seals now proves He lives. CHORUS Because He lives I can face tomorrow, Because He lives all fear is gone, Because I know He holds the future, And life Is worth, the living just because He lives. Now soon one day,I'll cross that river, I'll conquer death the grave and man, And as His shame gives me the victory. I'll shout through eternity because He lives. CHORUS Because He lives I can face tomorrow, Because He lives all fear is gone, Because I know He holds the future, And life Is worth, the living just because He lives.
