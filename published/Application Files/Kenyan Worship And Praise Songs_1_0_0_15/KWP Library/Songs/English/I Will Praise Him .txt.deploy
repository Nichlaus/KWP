 When I saw the cleansing fountain Open wide for all my sin, I obeyed the Spirit's wooing When He said, Wilt thou be clean? CHORUS I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain. Though the way seemed straight and narrow, All I claimed was swept away; My ambitions, plans, and wishes, At my feet in ashes lay. CHORUS I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain. Then God's fire upon the altar Of my heart was set aflame; I shall never cease to praise Him, Glory! glory to His name! CHORUS I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain. Blessed be the name of Jesus! I'm so glad He took me in; He's forgiven my transgressions, He has cleansed my heart from sin. CHORUS I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.
