 I believe it won't be long when He shall come He will come as a thief in the night, The world will go on as before, But to the gentiles He'll close heaven's door. I'm so glad that I saw the light And thank God that I made things right; I believe it is any time my friend, Look at the world, it's as dark as the night. Oh my friends ask Jesus today, to wash your sins away He'll hear your humble heart's cry Look in God's word and you'll find Him there.
