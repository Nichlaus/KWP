 I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out; I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, oh where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. I've been happy since the Lord brought me out; I've been happy since the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, oh where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. Aren't you glad that the Lord brought you out? Aren't you glad that the Lord brought you out? If it had not been for Jesus, oh where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out. I've been singing since the Lord brought me out, I've been singing since the Lord brought me out; If it had not been for Jesus, oh where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out.
