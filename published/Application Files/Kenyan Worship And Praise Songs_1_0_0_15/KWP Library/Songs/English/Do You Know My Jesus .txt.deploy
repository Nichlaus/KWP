 Have you a heart that's weary, Tending a load of care? Are you a soul that's seeking rest From the burdens your bear? CHORUS Do you know my Jesus? Do you know my friend? Have you heard He loves you, And that He will abide till the end. Where is your heart Oh pilgrim? What does your light reveal? Who hears your call for comfort? When naught but sorrow you feel. CHORUS Do you know my Jesus? Do you know my friend? Have you heard He loves you, And that He will abide till the end. Who knows your disappointments Who hears each time you cry Who understands your heartaches Who drives the tears from your eyes CHORUS Do you know my Jesus? Do you know my friend? Have you heard He loves you, And that He will abide till the end
