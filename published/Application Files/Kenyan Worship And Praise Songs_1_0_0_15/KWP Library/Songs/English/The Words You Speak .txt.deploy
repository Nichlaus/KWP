 All the flowers are All of our tomorrow Are in the seeds today In the seeds we're sowing. For the words you speak Are little seeds When they're planted,they will grow And you'll reap every seed that you sow. Our words can justify us Or condemn us on that day So why not say what God says And sow the seed the right way. Words of hate can kill Words of love can heal Words can make one glad And words can make one cry. And you'll reap every seed That you sow.
