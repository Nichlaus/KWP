Will you meet Him in the glory when He comes It is written, it is written, read and see Of the evil days that will be at the end When Gods people shall forget of He who saved them And in sin is where theyll find their dwelling place CHORUS Are you really back in Eden land of God? Can you really say you are His and His for sure? Are there things that God can ever, ever appreciate in you? Will you meet Him in the glory when He comes
