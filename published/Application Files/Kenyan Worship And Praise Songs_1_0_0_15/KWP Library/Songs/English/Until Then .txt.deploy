 My heart can sing when I pause to remember, A heartache here is but a stepping stone Along the trail that's winding always upward, This troubled world is not my final home. CHORUS But until then, my heart will go on singing, Until then, with joy I'll carry on, Until the day mine eyes behold the city Until the day God calls me home. The things of earth will dim and lose their value, If we recall,they're borrowed for a while And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble Remembered there,will only bring a smile. CHORUS But until then, my heart will go on singing, Until then, with joy I'll carry on, Until the day mine eyes behold the city Until the day God calls me home. This weary world with all its toil and struggle, May take its toil of misery and strife,  The soul of man is like a waiting eagle  When it's released it's destined for the sky.  CHORUS  But until then, my heart will go on singing,  Until then, with joy I'll carry on,  Until the day mine eyes behold the city  Until the day God calls me home.
