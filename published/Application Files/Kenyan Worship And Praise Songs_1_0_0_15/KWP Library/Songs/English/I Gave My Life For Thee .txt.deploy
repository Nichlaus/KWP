 I gave my life for thee, My precious blood I shed, That thou might ransomed be, And quickened from the dead: I gave My life for thee; What has thou given for Me? I spent long years for thee In weariness and woe, That an eternity Of joy thou mightest know: I spent long years for thee; Hast thou spent one for Me? My Father's home of light, My rainbow - circled throne, I left for earthly night, For wanderings sad and lone: I left it all for thee; Hast thou left aught for Me? I suffered much for thee, More than thy tongue can tell Of bitter agony To rescue thee from hell: I suffered much for thee; What canst' thou bear for Me? Lord,let my life be given, And every moment spent, For God, for souls, for heaven, And all earth's ties be rent, Thou gav'st Thyself for me, Now I give all for Thee.
