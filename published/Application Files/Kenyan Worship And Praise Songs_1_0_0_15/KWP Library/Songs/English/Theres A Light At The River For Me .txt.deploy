 There's a deep silent river flowing just beyond, And it's waters are deep and wide, But faith sees the Light yes,its definite Light, Just down by the river side. CHORUS There's a Light at the river, A Light at the river, There's a Light at the river I can see, My Lord will stand and hold In His hand, A Light at the river for me. To this deep silent river, I have come on my knees, I^m afraid for I know I have sinned; But the beckoning Light,leads me on through the night, To the waters where my soul may be cleansed. CHORUS There's a Light at the river, A Light at the river, There's a Light at the river I can see, My Lord will stand and hold In His hand, A Light at the river for me. To that deep silent river we will one day stand, And we'll cross over waters so wide But He'll carry us away to the realms of the day, To our home on the other side. CHORUS There's a Light at the river, A Light at the river, There's a Light at the river I can see, My Lord will stand and hold In His hand, A Light at the river for me. Many dear ones have gathered, Safe just before the Throne, Dip their wings on the misty tide, They'll pass over deeps and will never grow weak, In their home on the other side. CHORUS There's a Light at the river, A Light at the river, There's a Light at the river I can see, My Lord will stand and hold In His hand, A Light at the river for me.
