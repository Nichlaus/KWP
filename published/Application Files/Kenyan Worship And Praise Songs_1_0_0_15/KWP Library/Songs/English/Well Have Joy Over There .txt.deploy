 There is a longing here below Only God's people can know We'll be changed in a moment In the rapture far away We're looking for a city That Abraham did in His day I am longing for the bright and perfect day. CHORUS We'll have joy over there In that city bright and fair When we gather around and sing Amazing grace, We'll shout and dance about And we'll sing Amazing love Oh yes we'll sing Amazing grace over there, Over there. He'll call my name up there Before I climb those golden stairs We have loved ones there awaiting We'll meet at the Eastern gate Oh my brother lets press on Till this battle has been won I can hardly wait to see, My Saviour's face. CHORUS We'll have joy over there In that city bright and fair When we gather around and sing Amazing grace, We'll shout and dance about And we'll sing Amazing love Oh yes we'll sing Amazing grace over there, Over there.
