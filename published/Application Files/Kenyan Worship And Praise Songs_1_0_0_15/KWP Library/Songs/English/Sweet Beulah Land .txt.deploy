 CHORUS Beulah land am longing for you And some day on Thee I'll stand Then my home shall be eternal Beulah land, sweet Beulah land. (Beulah land, sweet Beulah Land) I'm kind of homesick for a country To which I've never been before No sad goodbye will there be spoken And time won't matter any more. CHORUS Beulah land am longing for you And some day on Thee I'll stand Then my home shall be eternal Beulah land, sweet Beulah land. (Beulah land, sweet Beulah Land) I'm looking up across the river Where my faith will end inside There's just a few more days to labour And I will take my heavenly flight. CHORUS Beulah land am longing for you And some day on Thee I'll stand Then my home shall be eternal Beulah land, sweet Beulah land. (Beulah land, sweet Beulah Land)
