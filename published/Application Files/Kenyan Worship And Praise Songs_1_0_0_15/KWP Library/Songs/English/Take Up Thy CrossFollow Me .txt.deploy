 I journeyed one day along a country road And there a stranger journeyed too Bent low beneath the burden of His load It was a cross, a cross I knew. CHORUS Take up Thy cross and follow me,follow me I hear the blessed Saviour's call How can I make a lesser sacrifice When Jesus gave His all. I cried Lord Jesus and He spoke my name I saw His hands all bruised and scarred I tried to kiss away the marks of shame The shame for me that He had borne. CHORUS  Take up Thy cross and follow me,follow me  I hear the blessed Saviour's call  How can I make a lesser sacrifice  When Jesus gave His all.  Thy cross I'll carry till the crown appears  The way I journey soon will end  When God Himself shall wipe all tears  And hold sweet fellowship with friends.  CHORUS  Take up Thy cross and follow me,follow me  I hear the blessed Saviour's call  How can I make a lesser sacrifice  When Jesus gave His all.
