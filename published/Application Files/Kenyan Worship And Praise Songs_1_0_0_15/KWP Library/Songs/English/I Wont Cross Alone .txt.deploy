 When I come to the river at ending of day, When the last winds of sorrow have blown; There^ll be somebody waiting to show me the way, I won^t have to cross Jordan alone. CHORUS I won't have to cross Jordan alone, Jesus died all my sins to atone; When the darkness I see, He'll be waiting for me, I won't have to cross Jordan alone. Often times I'm forsaken, and weary and sad, When it seems that my friends have all gone; There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad, I won't have to cross Jordan alone. CHORUS I won't have to cross Jordan alone, Jesus died all my sins to atone; When the darkness I see, He'll be waiting for me, I won't have to cross Jordan alone. Though the billows of sorrow and trouble may sweep, Christ the Saviour will care for His own; Till the end of the journey, my soul He will keep, I won't have to cross Jordan alone. CHORUS I won't have to cross Jordan alone, Jesus died all my sins to atone; When the darkness I see, He'll be waiting for me, I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
