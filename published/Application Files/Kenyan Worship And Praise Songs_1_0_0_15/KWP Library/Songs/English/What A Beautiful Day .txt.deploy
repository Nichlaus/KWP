 As I wake up with the morning, Of each day that passes by, And I listen to the sound upon my ears, I can't help but keep a watch Out toward the Eastern sky, . And I wonder if the Trumpets Will be the next sound that I hear. CHORUS What a beautiful day For the Lord to come again; What a beautiful day For Him to take His children Home How I long to see His face And to touch His nail-scarred hands. What a beautiful day For the Lord to come again. Califonia's almost ready now To sink beneath the sea; We're waiting for the final earthquake, It will soon be; For He told us in the Thunders, How the dead in Christ Shall rise; And we'll be changed in a moment; And we'll meet Him in the skies. CHORUS What a beautiful day For the Lord to come again; What a beautiful day For Him to take His children Home How I long to see His face And to touch His nail-scarred hands. What a beautiful day For the Lord to come again.
