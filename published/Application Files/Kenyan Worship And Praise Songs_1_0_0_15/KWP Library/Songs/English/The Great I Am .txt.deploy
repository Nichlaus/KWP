 I AM that spoke to Moses in the burning bush of fire, I AM the God of Abraham, the Bright and Morning Star. I AM the Rose of Sharon, from beginning whence I came; I AM the whole creation, and Jesus is My Name. CHORUS Oh, who do you say I am, and whence do you say I came, Do you know the Father, and can you tell His Name? In Jesus dwells the fullness of the Godhead, don't you see; Jesus is the great I AM, and the Lord of lords is He. I AM was before old Abraham, He rejoiced to see My day. When Jesus spoke these precious words, they stoned Him right away. Why do you stone Me? Jesus said, in a holy sweet command. Because you say you're the great I AM, we believe you^re just a man. CHORUS Oh, who do you say I am, and whence do you say I came, Do you know the Father, and can you tell His Name? In Jesus dwells the fullness of the Godhead, don't you see; Jesus is the great I AM, and the Lord of lords is He. It was on the Day of Pentecost, oh, how the fire did fall; The Holy Ghost descended and filled them one and all. Then Peter told the multitude, Repent of all your sins. About three thousand souls were buried in Jesus' precious Name CHORUS Oh, who do you say I am, and whence do you say I came, Do you know the Father, and can you tell His Name? In Jesus dwells the fullness of the Godhead, don't you see; Jesus is the great I AM, and the Lord of lords is He.
