 Most of my life I've been filled with despair Everything seems to slip by me Fear held my heart and death ruled my soul Then I drank at the well of mercy CHORUS The author of life gave me strength to go on He opened my eyes turned the darkness to dawn And now there Is sunshine and love in my heart Something Inside me Is singing The thirst in my soul now Is quenched every day As I drink at the well of His mercy. Now if you are thirsty come drink at this well You will never thirst again Like the woman at the well Jesus spoke to that day, Said, come drink at the well of Mercy. CHORUS The author of life gave me strength to go on He opened my eyes turned the darkness to dawn And now there Is sunshine and love in my heart Something Inside me Is singing The thirst in my soul now Is quenched every day As I drink at the well of His mercy.
