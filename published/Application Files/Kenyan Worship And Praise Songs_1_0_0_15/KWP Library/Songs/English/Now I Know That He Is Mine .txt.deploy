 CHORUS Now I know that He Is mine and am His forever He Is leading me along the way He'll be holding to my hand When I cross death's river, He will take the sting of death away. Tis so sweet to know,I have Jesus with me He is keeping me from sin and from strife He delivers me from condemnation Now I have eternal life. CHORUS Now I know that He Is mine and am His forever He Is leading me along the way He'll be holding to my hand When I cross death's river, He will take the sting of death away. Now I'm walking day by day With my wondrous Saviour He is lighting every step of the way And His love so real as He walks besides me And His peace will be my stay. CHORUS Now I know that He Is mine and am His forever He Is leading me along the way He'll be holding to my hand When I cross death's river, He will take the sting of death away.
