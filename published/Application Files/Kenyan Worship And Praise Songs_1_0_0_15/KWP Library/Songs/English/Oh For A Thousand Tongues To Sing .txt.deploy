 Oh for a thousand tongues to sing, My great Redeemer's praise, The glories of my God and King The triumphs of His Grace. My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim To spread through all the earth abroad, The honours of Thy Name. Jesus The Name that charms me most, That bids our sorrows cease, 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'Tis life,and health,and peace. He breaks the power of cancelled sin, He sets the prisoner free, His Blood can make the foulest clean, His Blood availed for me. Hear Him ye deaf;His praise ye dumb, Your loosened tongues employ; Ye blind behold, your Saviour come; And leap ye lame for joy!
