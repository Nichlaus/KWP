Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,Died for the sinner, paid all His due;Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the lamb,And I will pass, will pass over you,CHORUSWhen I see the blood,When I see the blood,When I see the blood,I will pass, I will pass over you.Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;All He has promised, that will He do;Wash in the fountain opened for sin,And I will pass, will pass over you.CHORUSWhen I see the blood,When I see the blood,When I see the blood,I will pass, I will pass over you.Judgement is coming, all will be there,Each one receiving justly his due;Hide in the saving sin-cleansing blood,And I will pass, will pass over you.CHORUSWhen I see the blood,When I see the blood,When I see the blood,I will pass, I will pass over you.Oh, great compassion! O boundless love!Oh loving kindness, faithful and true!Find peace and shelter under the blood,And I will pass, will pass over you.CHORUSWhen I see the blood,When I see the blood,When I see the blood,I will pass, I will pass over you.
