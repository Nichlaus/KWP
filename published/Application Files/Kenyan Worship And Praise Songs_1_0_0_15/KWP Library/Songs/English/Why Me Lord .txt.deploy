 Why me Lord, what have I ever done To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known? Tell me Lord, what did I ever do, That was worth loving you, And the kindness you've shown? CHORUS Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it So help me Jesus, I know what I am But now that I know that I've needed you So help me Jesus,my soul's in your hands. Try me Lord, if you think there's a way I can try to repay all I've taken from you May be Lord, I can show someone else What I've been thru' myself, On my way back to you. CHORUS Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it So help me Jesus, I know what I am But now that I know that I've needed you So help me Jesus,my soul's in your hands.
