 You seem so uncertain Just where to begin Youre afraid of betrayal, But youre needing a friend You say your situation Is entirely your fault Thro one foolish error It seems all is lost CHORUS Just cry out for mercy Jesus still saves Though were not worthy Hell never turn you away And youre lonely Hell hear when you pray Just cry out for mercy Jesus still saves A moment of weakness And a life of regret Oh its never easy To forgive and forget Your accusers around you They point fingers of men But He wont condemn you If youll whisper His name CHORUS Just cry out for mercy Jesus still saves Though were not worthy Hell never turn you away And youre lonely Hell hear when you pray Just cry out for mercy Jesus still saves
