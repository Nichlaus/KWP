 Jesus is pleading with my poor soul, Shall I be saved to-night? If I believe, He will make me whole, Shall I be saved to-night? Tenderly, sadly, I hear Him say, How can you grieve me from day to day? Shall I go on in the old, old way, Or shall I be saved to-night? Jesus was nail'd to the cross for me, Shall I be saved to-night? How can my heart so ungrateful be? Shall I be saved to-night? Now He will save me by grace divine, Now, if I will, I make Him mine, Can I the pleasure of earth resign? Shall I be saved to-night? Jesus is knocking at my poor heart, Shall I be saved to-night? What if His Spirit should now depart? Shall I be saved to-night? Over and over His voice I hear, Sweetly it falls on my list^ning ear: Shall I reject Him a friend so dear? Oh, shall I be saved to-night? What if that voice I should hear no more? Shall I be saved to-night? Quickly I'll open this bolted door, Save me, O Lord to-night! Blessed Redeemer, come in, come in, Pity my sorrow, forgive my sin! Now let Thy work in my soul begin, For I will be saved to-night!
