 CHORUS He didn't have to do it, thank God He did He didn't have to love me,thank God He did He didn't have to save me,thank God He did Am so glad He did. I was an outcast so far from home, No one to love me hope was almost gone, Then I felt the power of Jesus touch my life Am so glad He did. CHORUS He didn't have to do it, thank God He did He didn't have to love me,thank God He did He didn't have to save me,thank God He did Am so glad He did. When I was sick in body,the doctor shook his head, There is no hope for you the future is dark he said, Then I felt the power of God's mighty hand, Am so glad He did. CHORUS He didn't have to do it, thank God He did He didn't have to love me,thank God He did He didn't have to save me,thank God He did Am so glad He did.
