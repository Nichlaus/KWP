 CHORUS He is still working on me To make me what I ought to be It took about a week To make the moon and the stars The sun and the earth And Jupiter and Mars How loving and patient He must be He is still working on me. There really ought to be, A sign upon my heart Don't judge me yet, There's an unfinished part That I will be perfect Just according to His plan Fashioned by the Master's loving hands. CHORUS He is still working on me To make me what I ought to be It took about a week To make the moon and the stars The sun and the earth And Jupiter and Mars How loving and patient He must be He is still working on me. In the mirror of His Word Reflections that I see Makes me wonder why He never gave up on me He loves me as I am And helps me when I pray Remember He is the potter I am the clay. CHORUS He is still working on me To make me what I ought to be It took about a week To make the moon and the stars The sun and the earth And Jupiter and Mars How loving and patient He must be He is still working on me.
