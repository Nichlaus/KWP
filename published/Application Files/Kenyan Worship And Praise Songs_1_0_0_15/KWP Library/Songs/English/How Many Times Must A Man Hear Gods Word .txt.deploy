 Have you heard the shout As it went loud and clear Come out, come out my friend Don't partake of their creeds The mysteries have been revealed, It is evening time, keep your lamps trimmed and clean. CHORUS How many times must a man hear God's word Before he'll turn away from sin How many times can you reject God's Word Before He'll close the door on you; My friend you realize, God's spirit won't always strive God's won't always Strive with man. Through the mouth of a prophet God has spoken once again Repent from all your sins, Be baptised in Jesus name For His power is still the same Just believe the promise given to you. CHORUS How many times must a man hear God's word Before he'll turn away from sin How many times can you reject God's Word Before He'll close the door on you; My friend you realize, God's spirit won't always strive God's won't always Strive with man.
