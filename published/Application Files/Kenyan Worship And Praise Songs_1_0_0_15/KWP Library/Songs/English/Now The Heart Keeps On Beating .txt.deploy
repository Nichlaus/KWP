 Now the heart keeps on beating With each breath that you take Till the time appointed, only God knows Think of that last heartbeat And the last breath you take You'll stand before your Maker And you will stand alone. CHORUS So prepare today,and choose the right way, While the Master is calling and you hear Him say Come unto me He'll turn your night to day, If you reject His Word There is no other way. When a child of the King is being led In the way of temptations in this world Of the evil that surrounds, Then I'm so thankful for God's Spirit within That keeps me from wand'ring And draws me unto Him. CHORUS So prepare today,and choose the right way, While the Master is calling and you hear Him say Come unto me He'll turn your night to day, If you reject His Word There is no other way.
