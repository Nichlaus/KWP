 When I go to see my Saviour On that fair and distant Throne, And am free from things in life that make me sin, There'll be someone there to meet and greet me at the door, Open wide these pearly gates Am coming through! CHORUS To see the sea walker, The blind man healer, The leper cleansing Man of Galilee I'll see the soul Saviour, The one who set me free, Open wide these pearly gates Am coming through! All my friends and my relations Will be waiting there I pray; And my dear mother will be waiting there too; Am getting ready brother tell me how things there will be; Open wide these pearly gates  Am coming through!  CHORUS  To see the sea walker,  The blind man healer,  The leper cleansing Man of Galilee  I'll see the soul Saviour,  The one who set me free,  Open wide these pearly gates  Am coming through!
