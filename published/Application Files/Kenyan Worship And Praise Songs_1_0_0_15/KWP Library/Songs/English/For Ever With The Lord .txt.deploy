 Forever with the Lord! Amen, so let it be! Life from the dead is in that Word, 'Tis immortality. Here in the body pent, Absent from Him I roam, Yet nightly pitch my moving tent A day's march nearer home. My Father's house on high, Home of my soul, how near At times to faith's foreseeing eye Thy golden gates appear! Ah! Then my spirit faints To reach the land I love, The bright inheritance of saints, Jerusalem above. For ever with the Lord! Father,if 'tis Thy will, The promise of that faithful Word E^en here to me fulfil. Be Thou at my right hand, Then can I never fail; Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand: Fight, and I must prevail. So when my latest breath Shall rend the veil in twain, By death I shall escape from death, And life eternal gain. That resurrection word, That shout of victory; Once more, For ever with the Lord! Amen, so let it be!
