 Go search them today, On the mountains over hills My sheep gone astray, So far from their fold Go find them and bring them And ask me not why And I will reward when I come. CHORUS Go feed all my sheep, My little lambs too, (x3) And I will reward you when I come. I called my own chosen, Go bring them today, And when you are ready, So you'll have a resting day, Go find them and bring them, And ask me not why And I will reward when I come. CHORUS Go feed all my sheep, My little lambs too, (x3) And I will reward you when I come.
