 Oh get ready evening shadows fall Can you hear the Eliezar calling We have come into this wedding And our joy is now in Him In the evening when the camel trains come in It was a day in early spring time By an ancient wayside well Eliezar posed to rest his camel train He found a bride for Isaac as the evening shadows fell For his weary journey had not been in vain So he took a fair Rebecca like we do it now and then To Abraham and Isaac far away Now Rebecca loved her Isaac and He loved Rebecca too Oh it must have been a happy wedding day Now the blessed Holy spirit from our Father God above Has come down to earth to find a worldly bride And our Isaac over yonder has prepared the tents of love And He wants his fair Rebecca by his side Now we left our kinfold gladly and we bade this world goodbye We are going to a home beyond the sky Where well soon behold our Isaac in that blessed eternity Oh what a happy happy wedding that will be All things ready now the evening shadows fell Cant you hear the Eliezar calling We have come into this wedding and our joys is now in Him And the bridegroom bids His lovely Bride come in
