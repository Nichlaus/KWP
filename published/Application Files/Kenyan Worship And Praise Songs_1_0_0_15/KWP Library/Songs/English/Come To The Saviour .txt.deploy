 Come to the saviour Make no delay Here in His word He has shown us the way Here in our midst Hes standing today Tenderly saying come CHORUS Joyful, joyful will the meeting be When from sin our hearts are pure and free And we shall gather, saviour with thee In our eternal home Suffer the children oh hear his voice Let very heart leap forth and rejoice And let us freely make Him our choice Do not delay but come CHORUS Joyful, joyful will the meeting be When from sin our hearts are pure and free And we shall gather, saviour with thee In our eternal home Think once again, Hes with us today Heed now His blest command and obey Hear now His accents tenderly say will you, my children come? CHORUS Joyful, joyful will the meeting be When from sin our hearts are pure and free And we shall gather, saviour with thee In our eternal home
