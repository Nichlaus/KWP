 When Stephen was accused,lonely and bewildered, No one that day,would stand by his side, He looked in the heavens and saw the face of Jesus And He rolled him over the tide. CHORUS I've never had a prayer,He couldn't answer I've never shed a tear,He could't dry And when the waves of life are so hard you can't mount them He will roll you over the tide. When the world is chasing me,and my life becames a burden I want to run,but there's no place to hide, I'll just look up like Stephen to the right hand of the Father And He will roll me over the tide. CHORUS I've never had a prayer,He couldn't answer I've never shed a tear,He could't dry And when the waves of life are so hard you can't mount them He will roll you over the tide.
