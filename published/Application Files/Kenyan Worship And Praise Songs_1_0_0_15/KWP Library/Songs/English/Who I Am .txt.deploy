 Oh glorious victory,that day He set me free, And He made my heart His very throne. My life is no longer mine, I'm a prisoner of love divine, And now I live to praise His name. CHORUS Who I am, Lord, who I am, I can see now, who I am. A part of my Saviour, A part of His Word. It's a revelation (It's predestination) Of who I am. On Calvary He died,to redeem His lost Bride, The King of Kings,became my Saviour; This is God's great mystery Of love expressed to me, That Christ and I Might be made one! CHORUS Who I am, Lord, who I am, I can see now, who I am. A part of my Saviour, A part of His Word. It's a revelation (It's predestination) Of who I am.
