 Lord where would I be, If you had not gone, On that lonely hill to die at Calvary, What is man, that a King would leave His glory above and suffer in deep agony. CHORUS I owe my whole life to the crucified one, Who gave His all for me, With all that's in me I will praise His Holy name Praise God, for the crucified one. (Yes Jesus is the crucified one) He walked that lonely hill, With me in mind, I was wretched, naked and blind, My load was so great only One could bear Thank God for the crucified word. CHORUS I owe my whole life to the crucified one, Who gave His all for me, With all that's in me I will praise His Holy name Praise God, for the crucified one. (Yes Jesus is the crucified one)
