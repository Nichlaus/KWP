 As the deer panteth for the waters So my soul longeth after Thee You alone are my heart^s desire And I long to worship you. CHORUS You alone are my strength,my shield, To you alone may my spirit yield You alone are my heart's desire And I long to worship you. I want you more than gold or silver Only You can satisfy, You alone are the real joy giver And the apple of my eye. CHORUS You alone are my strength,my shield, To you alone may my spirit yield You alone are my heart's desire And I long to worship you. You are my friend and you are my brother Even though you are a King I love You more than any other So much more than anything. CHORUS You alone are my strength,my shield, To you alone may my spirit yield You alone are my heart's desire And I long to worship you.
