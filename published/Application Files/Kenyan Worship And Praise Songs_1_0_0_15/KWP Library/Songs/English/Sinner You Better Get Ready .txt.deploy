 CHORUS Oh sinner you better get ready, Oh, you better get ready hallelujah Sinner,you better get ready For a time's a'coming when the sinner must die. Oh God gave Noah the rainbow sign, Time's a'coming when the sinner must die, It won't be by water,but by fire next time, Time's a'coming when the sinner must die. CHORUS Oh sinner you better get ready, Oh, you better get ready hallelujah Sinner,you better get ready For a time's a'coming when the sinner must die. I thought I heard all the preachers say The time's a'coming when the sinner must die, You better get down on your knees and pray The time's a'coming when the sinner must die. CHORUS Oh sinner you better get ready, Oh, you better get ready hallelujah Sinner,you better get ready For a time's a'coming when the sinner must die. I heard my mother and sister saying Time's coming when the sinner must die, I heard my father and brother saying Dear sister, you better come now. CHORUS Oh sinner you better get ready, Oh, you better get ready hallelujah Sinner,you better get ready For a time's a'coming when the sinner must die.
