 Behold what manner of Man is this Who stills the raging sea; He heals the sick, the lame, the halt, And makes the blind to see, He opens all the prison doors And sets the captives free; Behold what manner of man is this, What manner of man is He! CHORUS He's the Lord of Glory, He is the great I AM; The Alpha and Omega, The beginning and the end; His name is Wonderful, The Prince of Peace is He; The Everlasting Father, Throughout Eternity. Behold what manner of man is this Who healed the lame and halt; Who said thy sins be forgiven thee, Take up thy bed and walk. He stands as the mighty Healer now, And cries look unto Me; Behold what manner of man is this, What manner of man is He! CHORUS He's the Lord of Glory, He is the great I AM; The Alpha and Omega, The beginning and the end; His name is Wonderful, The Prince of Peace is He; The Everlasting Father, Throughout Eternity.
