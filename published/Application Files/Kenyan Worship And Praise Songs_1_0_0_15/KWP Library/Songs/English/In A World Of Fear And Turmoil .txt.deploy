 In a world of fear and turmoil, In a race that seems so hard to run, Lord,I need Thy rich in - filling Even so, Lord Jesus, come. CHORUS Even so, Lord Jesus, come In my heart that I may see Your light; Though at times I've betrayed Thy trust - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. When my eyes shall spun the river, When I am gliding through the world unknown, May I say with all assurance - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. CHORUS Even so, Lord Jesus, come In my heart that I may see Your light; Though at times I've betrayed Thy trust - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. When my hope in Thee is ceasing, When my heart is dying in restlessness, When I am yearning for deliverance Even so, Lord Jesus, come. CHORUS Even so, Lord Jesus, come In my heart that I may see Your light; Though at times I've betrayed Thy trust - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. When I am yearning to do Thy will, When I am willing to proclaim Thy Name, And the problems of life come rolling - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. CHORUS Even so, Lord Jesus, come In my heart that I may see Your light; Though at times I've betrayed Thy trust - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. When my soul is full of troubles, And my eyes grow dim thro' sorrow and fear, Let me call upon Thy Name - Even so, Lord Jesus, come. CHORUS Even so, Lord Jesus, come In my heart that I may see Your light; Though at times I've betrayed Thy trust - Even so, Lord Jesus, come.
