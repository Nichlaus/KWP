 I was sitting alone and wondering About what Im supposed to do I cant deny the times I have made mistakes I cant hide from Him, He knew But I knew that deep within my soul I felt sorry, honest I did So I just cried and said forgive me Lord, forgive me again will you? CHORUS Justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified, justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified So often am discouraged When I count the times I fall cause He promised Id be victorious When I know Im not at all Then I heard an eagle scream Its voice quickened my soul He said youve not done it in the first place You are justified CHORUS Justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified, justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified He looked at your perfect picture Without blame spot or wrinkle, He didnt look at you where you are now He looked back from eternity He said youre just trapped in that body You by-passed your theophany You have not done it in the first place, Youre justified CHORUS Justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified, justified, justified You have not done it in the first place Youre justified
