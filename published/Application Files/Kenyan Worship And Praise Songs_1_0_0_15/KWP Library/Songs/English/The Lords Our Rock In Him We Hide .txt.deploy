 The Lord's our Rock In Him We Hide, A shelter in the time of storm, Secure whatever ill betide A shelter in the time of storm. CHORUS Oh, Jesus Is a Rock in a weary land A weary land, a weary land, Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land A shelter in the time of storm. A shade by day, defence by night, A shelter in the time of storm, No fears alarm, no foes affright A shelter in the time of storm. CHORUS Oh, Jesus Is a Rock in a weary land A weary land, a weary land, Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land A shelter in the time of storm. The raging storms may round us beat A shelter in the time of storm We'll never leave our safe retreat, A shelter in the time of storm. CHORUS Oh, Jesus Is a Rock in a weary land A weary land, a weary land, Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land A shelter in the time of storm.
