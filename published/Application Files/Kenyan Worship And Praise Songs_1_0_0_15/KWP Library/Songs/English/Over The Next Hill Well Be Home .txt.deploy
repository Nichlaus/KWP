 By the way the land is laying I think I'd be certain saying That over the next hill we'll be home It's a straight and narrow highway No detours and no by-ways And over the next hill we'll be home. CHORUS When we get there we are hoping That we'll find the gate is open And there'll be a refuge from the coming storm For the way's been long and weary But at last the end is nearing. And over the next hill we'll be home. By the speed that we're making I would say there's no mistaking That over the next hill we'll be home, There's a place that we're nearing That so many have been fearing But over the next hill we'll be home. CHORUS When we get there we are hoping That we'll find the gate is open And there'll be a refuge from the coming storm For the way's been long and weary But at last the end is nearing. And over the next hill we'll be home.
