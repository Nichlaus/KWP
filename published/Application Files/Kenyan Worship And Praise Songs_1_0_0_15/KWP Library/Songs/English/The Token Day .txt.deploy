 The Lord spoke to Moses and told him to say, To the children of Israel,in Goshen that day, Slay the lamb,take the blood,strike the post at the door, For I'll pass through Egypt this night And smite all the first borns. CHORUS Let the death angel pass, God's Bride's safe at last, In the Token He gave That we could be saved Oh Hallelujah, and glory to God The Blood's been applied, His spirit abides, Let the death angel pass. The sweet Holy Spirit is the token today And all that are under it,God said they'd be saved Outside of this Token,the lost would be bound If you want your loved ones saved, Let's get them in now. CHORUS Let the death angel pass, God's Bride's safe at last, In the Token He gave That we could be saved Oh Hallelujah, and glory to God The Blood's been applied, His spirit abides, Let the death angel pass.
