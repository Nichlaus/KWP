Have Thine Own Way, LordHave thine own way, Lord!Have thine own way!Thou art the Potter;I am the clay.Mould me and make meAfter Thy will,While I am waiting,Yielded and still.Have thine own way, Lord!Have thine own way!Search me and try me,Master, today!Whiter than snow, Lord,Wash me just now,As in Thy presence,Humbly I bow.Have thine own way, Lord!Have thine own way!Wounded and weary,help me, I pray!Power, all power,Surely is Thine!Touch me and heal me,Saviour divine!Have thine own way, Lord!Have thine own way!Hold o'er my beingAbsolute sway!Fill with Thy SpiritTill all shall seeChrist only, always,Living in me!
