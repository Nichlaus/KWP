 Who can cheer the heart like Jesus By His presence so divine Pure, tender and so precious Oh how blessed to call His name. CHORUS Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus He is more than life to me He is the fairest of ten thousands Jesus blessed Lord I know. Love of Christ so freely given Grace of God beyond degree Mercy higher than the heavens Deeper than the deepest sea. CHORUS Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus He is more than life to me He is the fairest of ten thousands Jesus blessed Lord I know. What a wonderful redemption Never can a mortal know How my sins though red as crimson Could be whiter than the snow. CHORUS Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus He is more than life to me He is the fairest of ten thousands Jesus blessed Lord I know. Every need His hand supplies Every good in Him I see Oh His divine hand supplies freely He is all in all to me. CHORUS Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus He is more than life to me He is the fairest of ten thousands Jesus blessed Lord I know. By the crystal flowing river With the ransomed I will sing And forever and ever Praise and glorify the King. CHORUS Oh what thrills my soul like Jesus He is more than life to me He is the fairest of ten thousands Jesus blessed Lord I know.
