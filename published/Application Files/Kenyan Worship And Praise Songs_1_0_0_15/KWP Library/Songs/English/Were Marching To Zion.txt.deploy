Come, we that love the Lord,And let our joys be known,Join in a song with sweet accord,Join in a song with sweet accord,And thus surround the throne,And thus surround the throne.CHORUSWe're marching to Zion,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;We're marching upward to Zion,The beautiful city of God.Let those refuse to singWho never knew our God;But Children of the heavenly King,But Children of the heavenly King,May speak their joys abroad,May speak their joys abroad.CHORUSWe're marching to Zion,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;We're marching upward to Zion,The beautiful city of God.The hill of Zion yieldsA thousand sacred sweetsBefore we reach the heavenly fields,Before we reach the heavenly fields,Or walk the golden streets,Or walk the golden streets.CHORUSWe're marching to Zion,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;We're marching upward to Zion,The beautiful city of God.Then let our songs abound,And every tear be dry;We're marching thru' Immanuel's ground,We're marching thru' Immanuel's ground,To fairer worlds on high,To fairer worlds on high.CHORUSWe're marching to Zion,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;We're marching upward to Zion,The beautiful city of God.
