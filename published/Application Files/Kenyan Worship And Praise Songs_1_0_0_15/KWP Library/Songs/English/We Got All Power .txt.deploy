 Give me your hand let's agree together That all of our enemies shall crumble at our feet For whatever we bind on earth,shall be bound in heaven In the name of Jesus, Satan has to flee. CHORUS Coz,we've got the power in the Name of Jesus We got the power In the Name of the Lord Though Satan rages we cannot be defeated We've got all power In the Name of the Lord. For many years now Satan has tried to stop us But the Bride of Jesus Lo! is still alive Like a mighty army We keep marching onward Winning every battle for the Lord's on our side. CHORUS Coz,we've got the power in the Name of Jesus We got the power In the Name of the Lord Though Satan rages we cannot be defeated We've got all power In the Name of the Lord.
