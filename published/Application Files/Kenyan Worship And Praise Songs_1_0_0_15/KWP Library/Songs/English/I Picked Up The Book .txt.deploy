 Well, I picked up the good Book And took me a long look I believed it each and every part But I sure rejoiced in knowing About the reaping and the sowing I really took that lesson to my heart. CHORUS So I cast my bread upon the water By helping my brother Struggling on life's stormy sea And I'm sowing a good seed By doing a good deed That'll come back,come back to me. Well, I can't buy my way to heaven But there's a Heaven waiting Purchased by our good and loving Lord And I'll go on striving Trusting arid surviving Holding on, expecting my reward. CHORUS So I cast my bread upon the water By helping my brother Struggling on life's stormy sea And I'm sowing a good seed By doing a good deed That'll come back,come back to me.
