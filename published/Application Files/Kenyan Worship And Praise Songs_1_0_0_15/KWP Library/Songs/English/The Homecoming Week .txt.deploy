 Upon our journey here below we meet with pain and loss; Sometimes there is a crown of thorns, sometimes the heavy cross. The dreary road to Calvary, the bitter goad and sting, But what's inside those gates of pearl will be worth everything. CHORUS When we're inside the gates of pearl, We'll learn a lot of things, We'll have a harp that's made of gold, Perhaps a thousand strings; We'll sing and shout and dance about, The Lamb will dry our tears; We'll have a grand homecoming week, The first ten thousand years. The shadows now begin to fall, the time is drawing nigh, When Christ our Lord shall come again like lightning from the sky. And while we wait and suffer here, praise God, we'll shout and sing. For one glimpse through those gates of pearl will be worth everything. CHORUS When we're inside the gates of pearl, We'll learn a lot of things, We'll have a harp that^s made of gold, Perhaps a thousand strings; We'll sing and shout and dance about, The Lamb will dry our tears; We'll have a grand homecoming week, The first ten thousand years. The precious blood of God's own Son has saved and sanctified. A wondrous people for His name and they are called the bride. Though here neglected and despised, one day the Lord will bring His chosen ones within the gates, and that's worth everything. CHORUS When we're inside the gates of pearl, We'll learn a lot of things, We'll have a harp that^s made of gold, Perhaps a thousand strings; We'll sing and shout and dance about, The Lamb will dry our tears; We'll have a grand homecoming week, The first ten thousand years.
