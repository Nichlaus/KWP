 I have a source of strength When I am weak It helps me through when life is pressing me I have a source of power from above Im covered over by a shield of blood CHORUS I claim the blood Jesus shed on calvary Those precious blood stains Were meant there just for me For all my sins, my sickness and my pain When I need healing I claim those precious blood stains I do not know how others make it through Who ever go to Calvary as I do For theres a healing cleansing stream that flows With peace that only His redeemed can know CHORUS I claim the blood Jesus shed on calvary Those precious blood stains Were meant there just for me For all my sins, my sickness and my pain When I need healing I claim those precious blood stains
