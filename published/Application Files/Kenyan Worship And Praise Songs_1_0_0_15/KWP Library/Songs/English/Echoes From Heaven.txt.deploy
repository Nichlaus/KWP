Far away among the angels,In the sweet celestial bowâ€™rs,Start the songs whose echoes gladdenAs they greet this world of ours.[Refrain]Hear the echoes filled with glory,From the bright angelic throng;Oh, the pure seraphic musicFinds an echo in our song,While it gently rolls along.How they stir the soul with rapture!How they thrill the chords of love!How they wake the songs of praises,Floating up to worlds above!Far away in worlds of glory,We can hear the music sweet,Where the streams of life are flowingAll along the golden street.Far away in fields of gloryWe shall meet, and God adore;And the sweet redemption storyWe shall sing forevermore.
