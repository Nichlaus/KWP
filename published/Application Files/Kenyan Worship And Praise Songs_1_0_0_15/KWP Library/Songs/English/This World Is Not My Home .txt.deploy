 This world is not my home I'm just passing through My treasures are laid up Somewhere beyond the blue. The angels beckon me From heaven's open door And I can't feel at home In this world anymore. CHORUS Oh Lord you know, I have no friend like you If heaven's not my home Then Lord what will I do? The angels beckon me From heaven's open door And I can't feel at home In this world any more. They're all expecting me And that's one thing I know I fixed it up with Jesus Many years ago I know He'll see me through Tho' I am weak and poor And I can't feel at home In this world any more. CHORUS Oh Lord you know, I have no friend like you If heaven's not my home Then Lord what will I do? The angels beckon me From heaven's open door And I can't feel at home In this world any more. Just over in the glory land, We'll live eternally; The saints on every hand Are shouting victory The songs of sweetest praise Drift back from heaven's shore AndI can't feel at home In this world any more. CHORUS Oh Lord you know, I have no friend like you If heaven's not my home Then Lord what will I do? The angels beckon me From heaven's open door And I can't feel at home In this world any more.
