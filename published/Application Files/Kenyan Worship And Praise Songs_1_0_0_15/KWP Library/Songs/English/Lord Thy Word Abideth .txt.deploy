 Lord,Thy Word abideth, And our footsteps guideth; Who it's truth believeth Light and joy receiveth. When our foes are near us Then Thy Word doth cheer us, Word of consolation, Message of Salvation. When the storms are over us, And dark clouds before us, Then it's light directeth, And our way protecteth. Who can tell the pleasure, Who recount the treasure, By Thy Word imparted To the simple-hearted? Word of mercy, giving, Succour to the living; Word of life, supplying Comfort to the dying. Oh,that we discerning Its most holy learning Lord, may love and fear Thee, Ever more be near Thee.
