 I wondered so far from my Father's home, And in my world of sin sometimes felt so alone, It seems I heard a voice within saying to me: The Father will welcome you back to the family. CHORUS Lord is there room in your mansion for me? I know I was wrong,but now I'm so sorry, I want to come home, I want to come home; Lord is there room in your mansion for me? All those wasted years,can I ever repay? Can I make them up,Oh Lord some way? Then I heard Him say,as in the story of the old: Welcome my child, back to the Father's fold CHORUS Lord is there room in your mansion for me? I know I was wrong,but now I'm so sorry, I want to come home, I want to come home; Lord is there room in your mansion for me?
