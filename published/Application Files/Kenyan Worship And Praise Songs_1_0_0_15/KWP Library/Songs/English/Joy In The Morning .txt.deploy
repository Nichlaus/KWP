 There'll be joy in the morning When the dead in Christ Shall rise in that day I can sing hallelujah going down I feel like travelling on There'll be joy in the morning in that day. CHORUS There'll be joy in the morning There'll be joy in the morning There'll be joy In the morning one of these days When we see all our loved ones Who have gone on before There'll be joy In the morning One of these days . . . (what a day) There are brothers in many dimensions That are waiting for that day When they'll be appearing to their own And with great anticipation We're longing for that day Oh what a beautiful (wonderful) morning Bright and fair. CHORUS There'll be joy in the morning There'll be joy in the morning There'll be joy In the morning one of these days When we see all our loved ones Who have gone on before There'll be joy In the morning One of these days . . . (what a day)
