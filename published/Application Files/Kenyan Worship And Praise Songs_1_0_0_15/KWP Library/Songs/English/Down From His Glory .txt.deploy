 Down from His glory, ever living story, My God and Saviour came, and Jesus was His Name. Born in a manger, to His own a stranger, A Man of sorrows, tears and agony. CHORUS Oh how I love Him! How I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all in all! The great Creator became my Saviour, And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him. What condescension, bringing us redemption; That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight; God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splender, Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul. Without reluctance, flesh and blood His substance, He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan. O glorious mystery, Sacrifice of Calvary, And now I know Thou wert the great I AM.^
