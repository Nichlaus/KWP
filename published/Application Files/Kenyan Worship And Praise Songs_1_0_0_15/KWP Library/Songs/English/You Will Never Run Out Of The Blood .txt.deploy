 You may run low on money You may run short of faith You may feel so unworthy To even stop and pray You may feel your lifes destroyed And youre running out of love Oh be strong, for youll never Run out of blood CHORUS Oh it covers forever For the rest of our days And it places protection In the paths that we take And forever until these bones return to the dust Oh my friend, youll never run out of the blood Well I know that you struggle In your life every day It seems all youve worked for Is being taken away And youre running out of patience And youre running out of love Oh be strong CHORUS Oh it covers forever For the rest of our days And it places protection In the paths that we take And forever until these bones return to the dust Oh my friend, youll never run out of the blood
