 I could be a drift on life's ocean And I could be in darkness of sin Well I could be in search of life's meaning And I may be lost, but thank God that I am saved. CHORUS And now I am free from all sin and shame, I'm walking in the light of the Word of God, No longer in darkness,and no more will I stray I'm a prisoner,to the one that's in my soul. I thank God that I am a prisoner, Yes, I'm so glad that Jesus took me in, Let me never shame my calling, And when time is over let eternity come in. CHORUS And now I am free from all sin and shame, I'm walking in the light of the Word of God, No longer in darkness,and no more will I stray I'm a prisoner,to the one that's in my soul.
