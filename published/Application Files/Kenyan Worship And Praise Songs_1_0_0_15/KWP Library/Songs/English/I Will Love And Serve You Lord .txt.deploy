 Oh, Lord my God, you did not spare your Son Who gave His life and shed His blood on calvary's tree Who in my place,bore all the shame, That I may love and serve you Lord until you come again. CHORUS (Lord) until you come again x2 I'll love you and I'll serve you Lord Until you come again. Great Redeemer,great things you^ve done Of saving a helpless sinner like me from Satan's bonds It was your plan,to save my soul, That I may love and serve you Lord until you come again. CHORUS (Lord) until you come again x2 I'll love you and I'll serve you Lord Until you come again. So when I cry, you hearken to my cry, And help me Lord when I'm oppressed from all sides And when I'm down, just about to fail, You give me strength to keep me standing until you come again. CHORUS (Lord) until you come again x2 I'll love you and I'll serve you Lord Until you come again.
