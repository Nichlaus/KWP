Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;Now, through the blood, I'm saved from all alarms;Down at the cross my heart is bending low;The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.CHORUSI love HimBecause He first loved meAnd purchased my salvationOn calvary^s tree.Once I was lost, and 'way down deep in sin;Once was a slave to passions fierce within;Once was afraid to trust a loving God;But now I'm cleansed from every stainThrough Jesus' blood.CHORUSI love HimBecause He first loved meAnd purchased my salvationOn calvary's tree.Once I was bound, but now I am set free;Once I was blind, but now the light I see;Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.CHORUSI love HimBecause He first loved meAnd purchased my salvationOn calvary's tree.
