  Upon life's boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,  I've fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;  When trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering over,  I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.  CHORUS  I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave.  I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave;  I've anchored in Jesus, for He hath power to save,  I've anchored in the Rock of Ages.  He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace;  His voice has stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease.  My pilot and deliverer to Him I all confide,  For always when I need Him, He's at my side.  CHORUS  I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave.  I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave;  I've anchored in Jesus, for He hath power to save,  I've anchored in the Rock of Ages.  He is my Friend and Savior, in Him my anchor's cast,  He drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast;  By faith I'm looking upward beyond life's troubled sea,  There I behold a haven prepared for me.  CHORUS  I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave.  I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave;  I've anchored in Jesus, for He hath power to save,  I've anchored in the Rock of Ages.
