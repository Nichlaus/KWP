 I owed a debt I could not pay And it was growing every day But Jesus, paid it all for me; At the cross of calvary, He died for men like you and me, What a Saviour, I love Him, yes I do. CHORUS He came a long,long way from heaven, To take away our sin and strife He came along,long way from heaven, To give to us eternal life. They crucified the Holy King, But He was not the one to blame, O Father, forgive these men, He prayed (said) And to the thief there at His side; He said to him before He died; This day ... you'll be with me in paradise.. CHORUS He came a long,long way from heaven, To take away our sin and strife He came along,long way from heaven, To give to us eternal life.
