 Some folks I know by their name Some folks know by their face Some are known, by their race But in the kingdom of our Lord Each soul has their place And in my mind, I have no doubt By names, weve been called out And weve been called out, For a purpose called out, To be a servant called out To raise a standard Hes called you out To raise the banner called out To be a witness called out To show forgiveness called out From the world, child youve been called out Within the prison, walls that day The jailer had bound their feet Stripped up their garment, there they lay Bleeding from where they were beaten But about midnight, all began to pray Silently started to sing The walls shook all, their bounds open wide God said youve been called out
