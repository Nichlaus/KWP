 Shackled by a heavy burden, 'Neath a load of guilt and shame; But then the hand of Jesus touched me And now I am no longer the same. CHORUS He touched, Oh, He touched me, And, Oh, the joy that floods my soul; Something happened and now I know, He touched me and made me whole. Since I met the blessed Saviour, Since He cleansed and made me whole; I will never cease to raise Him, I'll shout it while Eternity rolls. CHORUS He touched, Oh, He touched me, And, Oh, the joy that floods my soul; Something happened and now I know, He touched me and made me whole.
