 Have you wandered along On lifes long way Have you lived without love a life of fears Have you searched for that great hidden meaning? Or is your life filed with long wasted years CHORUS Wasted years, wasted years Oh how foolish As you walk on in darkness and fear Turn around turn around God is calling Hes calling you from a life of wasted years Search for wisdom and seek understanding Theres is someone who knows and always hears Come to Him! Come to Him! Your sins confessing You cant go on with a life of wasted years Dont you know Jesus died for all the sinners? He loves you and all your guilt he gladly bears Give it up, give it up the load youre carrying You cant go on with a life of wasted years CHORUS Wasted years, wasted years Oh how foolish As you walk on in darkness and fear Turn around turn around God is calling Hes calling you from a life of wasted years
