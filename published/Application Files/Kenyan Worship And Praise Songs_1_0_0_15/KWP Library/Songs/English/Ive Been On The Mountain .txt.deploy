 Well I've been on the mountain, and I've walked through the valleys, And when troubles come up Had my share; But heavens eternal, at the end of my journey Will be worth every mile of the trip. CHORUS Like a happy pilgrim who^s arrived on the shore And forgot how the waves tossed his ship, If I could see Jesus smile,hear Him say well done child It'll be worth every mile of the trip. Well I stood at the bedside of a Christiain departing, And I heard these last words from his lips: I see the crystal streams aflowing, And hear the gentle breeze blowing And its worth every mile of the trip. CHORUS Like a happy pilgrim who's arrived on the shore And forgot how the waves tossed his ship, If I could see Jesus smile,hear Him say well done child It'll be worth every mile of the trip.
