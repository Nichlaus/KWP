 Many years I have been looking for a place to call a home But I have failed here to find it so I must travel on; I don't care for a bright mansion on earth's sinking sand Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land. CHORUS Lord build me a cabin In the corner of glory land, In the shade of the tree of life that It may ever stand; Where I could hear the angels sing and shake Jesus hand Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land. Blessed Lord I'm not asking to live in this earth, For I know I'm not worthy of the splendour I have seen Lord I am asking for mercy while on Thee I stand, Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land. CHORUS Lord build me a cabin In the corner of glory land, In the shade of the tree of life that It may ever stand; Where I could hear the angels sing and shake Jesus hand Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land. I've many dear loved ones who've gone on that way, On that great final morning I shall I hear them sing, I'll join in their singing and playing in the band, Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land. CHORUS Lord build me a cabin In the corner of glory land, In the shade of the tree of life that It may ever stand; Where I could hear the angels sing and shake Jesus hand Lord build me a cabin in the corner of glory land.
