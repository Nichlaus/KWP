In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,God leads His dear children along;Where the water's cool flow bathes the weary one's feet,God leads His dear children along.CHORUSSome through the waters, Some through the flood,Some through the fire, but all through the Blood;Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,In the night season and all the day long.Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,God leads His dear children along;Sometimes in the valley in the darkest of nightGod leads His dear children along.CHORUSSome through the waters, Some through the flood,Some through the fire, but all through the Blood;Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,In the night season and all the day long.Tho^sorrows befall us, and satan oppose,God leads His dear children along;Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foesGod leads His dear children along.CHORUSSome through the waters, Some through the flood,Some through the fire, but all through the Blood;Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,In the night season and all the day long.Away from the mire, and away from the clayGod leads His dear children along;Away up in glory, eternity^s day,God leads His dear children along.CHORUSSome through the waters, Some through the flood,Some through the fire, but all through the Blood;Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,In the night season and all the day long.
