  There is a Name I love to hear,  it falls like music on my ear,  It's the Name of Jesus Christ the Lord;  He came from the Father in Heaven above,  He died on the cross just to show us His love;  Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name.  CHORUS  Great is the Lord! Great is the Lord!  Great is the Father, great is the Son,  Great is the Holy Ghost, and these three are One;  Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name.  He is the dear Saviour of men, He gave  His own life just to free us from sin,  It's the Name of Jesus Christ the Lord;  the wonderful Counselor, the Man  from Galilee, He calmed the angry  waters and He walked on the sea;  Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name.  CHORUS  Great is the Lord! Great is the Lord!  Great is the Father, great is the Son,  Great is the Holy Ghost, and these three are One;  Jesus, yes, Jesus is His Name.
