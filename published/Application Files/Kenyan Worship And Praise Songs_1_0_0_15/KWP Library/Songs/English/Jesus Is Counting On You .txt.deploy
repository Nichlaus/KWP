 The Lord said, stand up Paul And dry up your tears You must preach this gospel For many long years Go down to Damascus The way that is straight You'll find Ananias And there you must wait. CHORUS I counted on Jonah,I counted on Cain, I counted on Adam but he was the same I counted on Judas but he proved untrue So go tell the world Paul I'm counting on you Three days have passed by Lord And yet I don't see, and here stands my brother He's talking to me He says brother Paul,The Lord in the sky Has sent me to heal you and open your eyes. I'll send you to the gentiles,I'll send you to Rome But Paul you must suffer,till I call you home, They'll put you in prison,you'll wreck out in sea, But Paul you must preach all this gospel for me. CHORUS I counted on Jonah,I counted on Cain, I counted on Adam but he was the same I counted on Judas but he proved untrue So go tell the world Paul I'm counting on you
