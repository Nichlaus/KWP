When upon the clouds of heaven,Christ shall come to earth again,Will the world be glad to see Him,When our Lord shall come again?CHORUSThere'll be singing, there'll shouting,There'll be sorrow, there'll be pain,There'll be weeping, there'll be praying,When our Lord shall come again.Will His coming bring rejoicing?Or will it bring tears and pain?Are you ready to receive Him,When our Lord shall come again?CHORUSThere'll be singing, there'll shouting,There'll be sorrow, there'll be pain,There'll be weeping, there'll be praying,When our Lord shall come again.Will you join in lamentation?Or the angel's glad refrain?Will you help His people crown Him,When our Lord shall come again?CHORUSThere'll be singing, there'll shouting,There'll be sorrow, there'll be pain,There'll be weeping, there'll be praying,When our Lord shall come again.Work and pray till Jesus calls you,Help to gather in the grain,Then with joy you'll meet the Saviour,When our Lord shall come again.CHORUSThere'll be singing, there'll shouting,There'll be sorrow, there'll be pain,There'll be weeping, there'll be praying,When our Lord shall come again.
