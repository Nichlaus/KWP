 Men will always preach the promises of yesterday, Of a baby to be born in Bethlehem, They tell of the ark and of Noah, And they marvel at the faith of Abraham. CHORUS But what has God done in your day, Are you looking to the Word for yesterday? There's a promise to be fulfilled In every age, Oh what has God done In you day? We all know of the story of Jonah, And of Daniel and the lions we often tell, We know of the promise that saved them, But do you know the promise for your day as well? CHORUS But what has God done in your day, Are you looking to the Word for yesterday? There's a promise to be fulfilled In every age, Oh what has God done In you day? Do you know there's a promise for our time, Have you heard of Malachi 4? For behold I will send you Elijah, Before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. CHORUS But what has God done in your day, Are you looking to the Word for yesterday? There's a promise to be fulfilled In every age, Oh what has God done In you day?
