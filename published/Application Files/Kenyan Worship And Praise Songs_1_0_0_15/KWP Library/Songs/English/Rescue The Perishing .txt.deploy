 Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying, Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave Weep oer the erring ones, Lift up the fallen Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save Rescue the perishing, care for the dying; Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save Tho they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting, Waiting the penitent child to receive; Plead with then earnestly Plead with then gently He will forgive if they only believe Down in the human heart, Crushd by the temper, Feelings lie buried that grace can restore; Touched by a loving heart, Wakened by kindness, Cords that were broken will vibrate once more Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it; Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide, Back to the narrow way, Patiently win them; Tell the poor wanderer a saviuor has died
