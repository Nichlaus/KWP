 My faith has found a resting place Not in a form or creed I trust the ever-living one His wounds for me shall plead CHORUS I need no other argument I need no other plea It is enough that Jesus died  And that He died for me  Enough for me that Jesus saves  This ends my fear and doubts  A sinful soul I come to Him  Hell never cast me out  CHORUS  I need no other argument  I need no other plea  It is enough that Jesus died  And that He died for me  My heart is leaning on the word  The written word of God  Salvation by my saviours name  Salvation through His blood  CHORUS  I need no other argument  I need no other plea  It is enough that Jesus died  And that He died for me  My great physician heals the sick  The lost He came to save  For me His precious blood He shed  For me His life He gave  CHORUS  I need no other argument  I need no other plea  It is enough that Jesus died  And that He died for me
