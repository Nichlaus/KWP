I know not why God's wondrous graceTo me He hath made known,Nor why, unworthy, Christ in loveRedeemed me for His own.CHORUSBut I know whom I have believeth,And am persuaded that He is ableTo keep that which I've committedUnto Him against the day,I know not how this saving faithTo me he did impart,Nor how believing in His wordWrought peace within my heartCHORUSBut I know whom I have believeth,And am persuaded that He is ableTo keep that which I've committedUnto Him against the day,I know not how the Spirit moves,Convincing men of sin,Revealing Jesus through the Word,Creating faith in Him.CHORUSBut I know whom I have believeth,And am persuaded that He is ableTo keep that which I've committedUnto Him against the day,I know not what of good or illMay be reserved for me,Of weary ways or golden days,Before His face I see.CHORUSBut I know whom I have believeth,And am persuaded that He is ableTo keep that which I've committedUnto Him against the day,I know not when my Lord may come,At night or noonday fair,Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,Or meet Him in air.CHORUSBut I know whom I have believeth,And am persuaded that He is ableTo keep that which I've committedUnto Him against the day,
