 God is here,and that to bless us With the Spirit's quickening power: See,the cloud already bending, Waits to drop the grateful shower. CHORUS Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, Let the shower of blessing fall We are waking,we are waiting, Oh,revive the hearts of all. God is here! We feel His presence In this consecrated place, But we need the soul refreshing Of His free, unbounded grace. CHORUS Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, Let the shower of blessing fall We are waking,we are waiting, Oh,revive the hearts of all.
