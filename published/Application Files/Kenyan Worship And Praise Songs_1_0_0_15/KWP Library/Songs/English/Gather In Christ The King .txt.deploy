 Shall we gather in Tucson, or in Jeffersonville? That was the question that was asked one day We just want to be,where we will be caught away. CHORUS The prophet answered the question, He said It's been revealed to me, I will tell you where to gather Just gather In Christ the King. Up in Sabino Canyon the Messenger was in prayer The Sword of the King fell in his hand It was the Word of God from the Son of Man. CHORUS The prophet answered the question, He said It's been revealed to me, I will tell you where to gather Just gather In Christ the King. Now that we know where to gather, Now that we know where to stay, Let's strive each day to abide in Him, So when the time comes we will be there. CHORUS The prophet answered the question, He said It's been revealed to me, I will tell you where to gather Just gather In Christ the King
