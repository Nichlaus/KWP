 Oh, how well I remember in the old-fashioned days, When some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned ways; In the old-fashioned meetings,as they tarried there, In the old-fashioned manner, How God answered their prayer. CHORUS Twas an old-fashioned meeting, In an old-fashioned place, Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me,and saved me in the old-fashioned way. There was singing,such singing of those old-fashioned airs! There was power, such power in those old-fashioned prayers, An old-fashioned conviction made the sinner pray, And the Lord,heard and saved him, In the old-fashioned way. CHORUS Twas an old-fashioned meeting, In an old-fashioned place, Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me,and saved me in the old-fashioned way. Well, they say it is better,Things have changed don't you know, And the people in general,seem to think it is so; And they call me old-fashioned when I dare to say, That I like it far better in the old-fashioned way. CHORUS Twas an old-fashioned meeting, In an old-fashioned place, Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me,and saved me in the old-fashioned way. If the Lord never changes,as the fashions of men, If He's always the same, why, He is old-fashioned then! As an old-fashioned sinner saved thro^ old time grace, Oh, I'm sure He will take me to an old-fashioned place. CHORUS Twas an old-fashioned meeting, In an old-fashioned place, Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me,and saved me in the old-fashioned way.
