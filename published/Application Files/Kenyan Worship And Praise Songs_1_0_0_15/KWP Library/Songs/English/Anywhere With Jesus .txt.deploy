 Anywhere in Jesus I can safely go Anywhere He leads me in this world below Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid Anywhere! anywhere! Fear I cannot know Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone Other friends may fail me, He is still my own Though His hand my lead me over drearest ways Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep When the darkling shadows round about me creep Knowing I shall waken never more to roam Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home
