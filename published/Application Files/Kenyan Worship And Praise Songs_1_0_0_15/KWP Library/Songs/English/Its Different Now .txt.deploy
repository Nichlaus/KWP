 Once I was lost in sin,I had no peace within To save my heavy soul,I knew not how, But Jesus came to me, and by His grace am free Now its different oh, so different now. CHORUS Its different now, since Jesus saved my soul Its different now, since Jesus made me whole Oh Satan was not In rest When Jesus made me free Now its different,oh so different now. Now my hopes are bright, I praise day and night How He could change me so I knew not how But praise the Lord its done The victory now is mine, Now its different oh, so different now. CHORUS Its different now, since Jesus saved my soul Its different now, since Jesus made me whole Oh Satan was not In rest When Jesus made me free Now its different,oh so different now.
