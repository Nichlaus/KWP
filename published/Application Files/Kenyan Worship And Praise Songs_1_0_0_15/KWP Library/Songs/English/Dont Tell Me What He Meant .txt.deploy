 Now the same old devil gave the same old problems When the Lord walked the earth down here He was always deceiving and causing confusion To anyone who would hear He was always trying to cause unbelief For he didnt want a poor soul to see That all youve gotta do is only to believe Just believe what the messenger said CHORUS Dont tell me what he meant Just tell me what he said Dont tell me what he meant Just tell me what he said I dont have no time for private Interpretations my friend Just tell me what he said Dont tell me what he meant Oh no! Tell me what he said And dont tell me what he meant Now today, strange voices we can hear All over through out the land Trying to teach what the messenger said They just tell so much higher than him Theyve a new revelation and interpretation And theyll tell you they are the leaders now But little bride you just stay with the tapes Gods vindicated what the messenger said CHORUS Dont tell me what he meant Just tell me what he said Dont tell me what he meant Just tell me what he said I dont have no time for private Interpretations my friend Just tell me what he said Dont tell me what he meant Oh no! Tell me what he said And dont tell me what he meant
