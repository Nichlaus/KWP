 There is a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord, Where the call of His Spirit is lost And you hurry along,with a pleasure mad throng Have you counted? Have you counted the cost? CHORUS Have you counted the cost if your soul should be lost Though you gain the whole world for your own, Even though it may be, that the line you have crossed, Have you counted? Have you counted the cost? You may barter your hope of eternity reign For a moment of joy at the most For the glitter of sin and the things it will win Have you counted? Have you counted the cost? CHORUS Have you counted the cost if your soul should be lost Though you gain the whole world for your own, Even though it may be, that the line you have crossed, Have you counted? Have you counted the cost? While the door of mercy is open to you Even though the depth of His love you exhaust Won't you come and be healed,won't you whisper I yield Have you counted? Have you counted the cost? CHORUS Have you counted the cost if your soul should be lost Though you gain the whole world for your own, Even though it may be, that the line you have crossed, Have you counted? Have you counted the cost?
