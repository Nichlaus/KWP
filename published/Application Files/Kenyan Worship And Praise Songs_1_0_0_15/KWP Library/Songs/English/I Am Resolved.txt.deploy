I am Resolved no longer to linger,Charmed by the world delight,Things that are higher, things that are nobler,These have allured my sight.CHORUSI will hasten to him,Hasten so glad and free,Jesus, greatest, highest,I will come Thee.I am Resolved to go to the Saviour,Living my sin and strife,He is the true one, He is the just one,Ha hath the words of life.CHORUSI will hasten to him,Hasten so glad and free,Jesus, greatest, highest,I will come Thee.I am Resolved to follow the Saviour,faithful and true each day;Heed what He sayeth, do what he willeth,He is the living way.CHORUSI will hasten to him,Hasten so glad and free,Jesus, greatest, highest,I will come Thee.I am Resolved to enter the kingdom,Living the paths of sins;Friends may oppose me, foes may besets me,Till will I enter in.CHORUSI will hasten to him,Hasten so glad and free,Jesus, greatest, highest,I will come Thee.I am Resolved, and who will go with me?Come friends without delay, Thought by the Bible, lead by the spirit, Will walk the heavenly way.CHORUSI will hasten to him,Hasten so glad and free,Jesus, greatest, highest,I will come Thee.
