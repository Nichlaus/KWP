 I am saved and I am healed By the Holy Ghost I am saved Though I do not understand it all you see But I believe all that I've heard Every promise in Gods word Its enough for me to know God said so CHORUS If God said so then that the way its got to be It doesnt matter how things look or what I feel or see Gods promises were made for you and me And it its in the word I know God said so. Have faith in God my friend for thats just what Jesus said Its not based on what you do or think or say its not hard to figure out, trust in God and dont you doubt All you really need to know is God said so CHORUS If God said so then that the way its got to be It doesnt matter how things look or what I feel or see Gods promises were made for you and me And it its in the word I know God said so. Now theres a promise that I^ve heard That God always keeps His word And thats good enough for me The price was paid at Calvary Its enough just to believe Trust in God and youll receive CHORUS If God said so then that the way its got to be It doesnt matter how things look or what I feel or see Gods promises were made for you and me And it its in the word I know God said so.
