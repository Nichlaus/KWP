 I've come too far to look back again There's nothing behind me, All the pleasures I used to love Have all faded from view, There's a new day ahead of me All my heartaches are over For I left them at Calvary When my new life began. CHORUS I've come too far to look back My feet have walked thru' the valley I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers, Desert places I know, But I'm nearing that home shore Where the redeemed are rejoicing Heaven angels are singing I've come too far to look back. Just took around there's no happiness There's no reason for living Life will give you a broken heart Full of sorrow and fear But turn around don't look back again, Face the new day before you, Place your heartaches in Jesus Christ He can mend broken hearts. CHORUS I've come too far to look back My feet have walked thru' the valley I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers, Desert places I know, But I'm nearing that home shore Where the redeemed are rejoicing Heaven angels are singing I've come too far to look back.
