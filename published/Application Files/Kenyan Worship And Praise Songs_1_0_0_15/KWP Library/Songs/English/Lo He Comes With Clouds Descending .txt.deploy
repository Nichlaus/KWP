 Lo, he comes with clouds descending Once for favored sinners slain Thousand, Thousand saints attending Swell the triumph of His train Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Christ appears on earth to reign Every eye shall now behold Him Robed in dreadful majesty Those who set at naught and sold Him Pierced and nailed Him to the tree Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, Shall the true Messiah see Now redemption long expected See in solemn pomp appear All His saints , by man rejected Now shall eet Him in the air Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! See the day of God appear The dear tokens of His passion Still His dazzling body bears Cause of endless exultation To His ransomed worshippers With what rapture, with what rapture With what rapture, with what rapture Gaze we on those glorious scars Ye amen! Let all adore Him High on Thine eternal throne Saviour, take the power and glory Claim the kingdom for Thine own Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Come, Lord come.
