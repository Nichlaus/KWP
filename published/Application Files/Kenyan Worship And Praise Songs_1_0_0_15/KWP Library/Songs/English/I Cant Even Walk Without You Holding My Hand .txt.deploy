 I thought that number one, would always be me, I thought I could be, what I wanted to be, I thought that I could build on lifes sinking sand, But I cant even walk, without you holding my hand. CHORUS Lord I cant even walk, without you holding my hand, Mountains too high, and the valleys too wide, Down on my knees, Ill learn to stand, Because I cant even walk, without you holding my hand. I thought, that I could do, a lot on my own, I thought I could make it, all alone, I thought of myself, as a mighty big man, But I cant even walk, without you holding my hand. CHORUS Lord I cant even walk, without you holding my hand, Mountains too high, and the valleys too wide, Down on my knees, Ill learn to stand, Because I cant even walk, without you holding my hand. I thank that I've made Jesus, my all in all, From now on, when Im in trouble on, His name Ill call, If I cant trust in Him, Id be less than a man, Because I cant even walk, without you holding my hand. CHORUS Lord I cant even walk, without you holding my hand, Mountains too high, and the valleys too wide, Down on my knees, Ill learn to stand, Because I cant even walk, without you holding my hand.
