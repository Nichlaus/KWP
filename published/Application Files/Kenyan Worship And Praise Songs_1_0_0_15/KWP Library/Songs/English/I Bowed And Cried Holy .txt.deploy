 I dreamed I went to that city called glory, So bright and so fair, When I entered the gate I cried, Holy, the angels all met me there; They showed me from mansion to mansion, And oh, the sights I saw, But I said, I want to see Jesus, The One who died for all. CHORUS Then I bowed on my knees and cried, Holy, Holy, Holy, I clapped my hands and sang, Glory, Glory to the Son of God. I thought when I entered that city, My friends knew me well. They showed me all through heaven, The scenes are too numerous to tell; They showed me Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Mark, Luke, and Timothy, But I said, I want to give praise, To the One who died for me. CHORUS Then I bowed on my knees and cried, Holy, Holy, Holy, I clapped my hands and sang, Glory, Glory to the Son of God. I thought when I saw my Saviour, I just fell right down before Him, Oh! Glory to God! Singing, Praise to the name of the Lord; I bowed down and worshipped Jehovah, My friend of Calvary, For I wanted to give praise to Jesus, For saving a sinner like me. CHORUS Then I bowed on my knees and cried, Holy, Holy, Holy, I clapped my hands and sang, Glory, Glory to the Son of God.
