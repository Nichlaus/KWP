 I've believed the true report, Hallelujah to the Lamb, I have passed the outer court, O glory be to God, I am all on Jesus' side on the altar sanctified, To the world and sin I've died, Hallelujah to the Lamb. Chorus I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, Hallelujah, Hallelujah; I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, For I'm living in the presence of the King. I'm a king and priest to God, Hallelujah to the Lamb, By the cleansing of the Blood, O glory be to God, By the Spirit's pow'r and Light, I am living day and night, In the holiest place so bright, Hallelujah to the Lamb. Chorus I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, Hallelujah, Hallelujah; I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, For I'm living in the presence of the King. I have passed the outer veil, Hallelujah to the Lamb, Which did once God's light conceal, O glory be to God, But the blood has brought me in, To God's holiness so clean, Where there's death to self and sin. Hallelujah to the Lamb. Chorus I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, Hallelujah, Hallelujah; I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, For I'm living in the presence of the King. I'm within the holiest place, Hallelujah to the Lamb, I have passed the inner veil, O glory be to God, By the power of the blood, I am sanctified to God, Now the Lord is my abode, Hallelujah to the Lamb Chorus I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, Hallelujah, Hallelujah; I have crossed the riven veil Where the glory never fails, For I'm living in the presence of the King.
