 Since I started for the Kingdom, Since my life He controls, Since I gave my heart to Jesus, The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows. CHORUS The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows. The more that I love Him more the love He bestows Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows; The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows. Every need He supplies Every day my way gets brighter The longer I serve Him The sweeter He grows. CHORUS The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows. The more that I love Him more the love He bestows Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows; The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows.
