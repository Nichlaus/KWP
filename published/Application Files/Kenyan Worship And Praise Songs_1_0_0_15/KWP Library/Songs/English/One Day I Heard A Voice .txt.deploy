 One day I heard a voice saying Make the Lord your choice, He'll take away your every sin And set you free; So I came to Him by faith And He took my sins away, Now I don't want nothing here to hinder me. CHORUS I don't want nothing here to hinder me For some day His blessed face I long to see It makes no difference what the cost, Or how heavy is my cross But I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Many times I'm tossed about, Many times I do without; And many times I'm burdened With a load of care But I know if I'll be true Some sweet day He'll see me through If I don't let nothing here to hinder me. CHORUS I don't want nothing here to hinder me For some day His blessed face I long to see It makes no difference what the cost, Or how heavy is my cross But I don't want nothing here to hinder me.
