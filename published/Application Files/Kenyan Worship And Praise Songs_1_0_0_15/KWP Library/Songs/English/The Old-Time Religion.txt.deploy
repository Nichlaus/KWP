It's the old-time Holy Spirit.And the devil won't go near It,That's the reason people fear It;But It's good enough for me.CHORUSGive me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,It^s good enough for me.It will make you stop your lying;It will save you when you're dying;It will start the devil flying;And it's good enough for me.CHORUSGive me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,It's good enough for me.It's so good I want no other,For It makes me love my brother;And It brings things from under cover,And It's good enough for me.CHORUSGive me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,Give me that old-time religion,It^s good enough for me.(It was good in the fiery furnace ...)(It was good for Paul and Silas ...)(It was good for our fathers ...)(It was good for Brother Branham ...)(Makes me love everybody ...)(It will do when I am dying ...)
