 The times that we're living in are so dark, From the true word many shall depart, Refusing to hear the Word of God for this our day A word for the Bride Jesus has sent Out of His mouth the Word of God went, Spoken to us by God's Prophet for this our day. CHORUS There's food in the storehouse (food in the storehouse x 2) There's plenty of food in the storehouse of God's Word No shortage of meat, no shortage of water, Come let us feast, my sister and brother; There's plenty of food in the storehouse of God's Word. Down through the years these tapes have met, Round and around the world they've sent,feeding the sheep, The Word of God that is pure... Stay with the Tapes,the prophet has said Don't add to anything I have said, Stay with the Word given to us for this our day. CHORUS There's food in the storehouse (food in the storehouse x 2) There's plenty of food in the storehouse of God^s Word No shortage of meat, no shortage of water, Come let us feast, my sister and brother; There's plenty of food in the storehouse of God's Word.
