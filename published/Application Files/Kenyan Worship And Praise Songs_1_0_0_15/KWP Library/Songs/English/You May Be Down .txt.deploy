 You may be down and think that God has somehow forgotten, That you are faced with circumstances You can't get through Right now it seems like there's no way Out and you're going under, God's proven time and time again He'll take care of you. CHORUS He'll do it again for you, Yes, He'll do it again Just take a look at where you are now And where you have been Hasn't He always come through for you He's the same now and then You may not know how You may know when But, He'll do it again. God knows the things you're going through And He knows the hurtings, Yes, He knows just how your heart has been broken in two But He's God of the sun and the stars and the seas He is your Father,He'll calm the storm And He'll find some way to fix it for you. CHORUS He'll do it again for you, Yes, He'll do it again Just take a look at where you are now And where you have been Hasn't He always come through for you He's the same now and then You may not know how You may know when But, He'll do it again.
