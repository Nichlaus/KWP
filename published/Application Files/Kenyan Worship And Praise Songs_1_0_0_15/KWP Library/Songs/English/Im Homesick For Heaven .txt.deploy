 Somewhere beyond life's sunset A home is awaiting for me Somewhere beyond tomorrow There's endless beauty to see Some day I'll be rewarded A crown of life I will wear I have grown so homesick for heaven For Jesus is waiting up there. CHORUS I am homesick now for heaven, I'm longing now to go I'll leave this world for ever This world of sin here below Our trials will all be over We'll shout the victory, I've grown so homesick for heaven What a wonderful place that will be!
