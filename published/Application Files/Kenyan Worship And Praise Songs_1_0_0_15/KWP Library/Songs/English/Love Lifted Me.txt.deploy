I was sinking deep in sin,Far from the peaceful shore,Very deeply strained within,Sinking to rise no more;But the MAster of the seaHeard my despairing cry,From the waters lifted me,Now safe am I.CHORUSLove lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.Love lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.All my heart to Him I give,Ever to Him I'll cling,In His blessed presence live,Ever His praises sing,Love so mighty and so trueMerits my soul's best songs;Faithful, loving service, tooTo Him belongs.CHORUSLove lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.Love lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.Souls in danger, look above,Jesus completely saves;He will lift you by His loveOut of the angry wavesHe's the Master of the sea,Billows His will obey;He your Saviour wants to be;Be saved today.CHORUSLove lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.Love lifted me! Love lifted me!When nothing else could help, love lifted me.
