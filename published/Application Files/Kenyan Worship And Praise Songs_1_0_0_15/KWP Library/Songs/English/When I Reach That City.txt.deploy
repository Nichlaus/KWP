On top of Mount Zion is a city,And the earth with glory it doth fill;I shall look on its beauty in the morningWhen I reach that city on the hill.CHORUSOh, that city on Mount Zion,Tho'a pilgrim, yet I love Thee still;I'll not love thee, through the ages,When I reach that city on the hill.I^m invited to come home to that city,For the Word says, whosoever will,And I'll find there a mansion for me waitingWhen I reach that city on the hill.CHORUSOh, that city on Mount Zion,Tho'a pilgrim, yet I love Thee still;I'll not love thee, through the ages,When I reach that city on the hill.Death will never molest me in that city,Never leave me lying cold and chill;And I'll enter to live up there foreverWhen I reach that city on the hill.CHORUSOh, that city on Mount Zion,Tho'a pilgrim, yet I love Thee still;I'll not love thee, through the ages,When I reach that city on the hill.So I'll stay here until my Saviour calls me,Trying daily to perform His will;Then He'll say unto me, Well done,up yonder,When I reach that city on the hill.CHORUSOh, that city on Mount Zion,Tho'a pilgrim, yet I love Thee still;I'll not love thee, through the ages,When I reach that city on the hill.
