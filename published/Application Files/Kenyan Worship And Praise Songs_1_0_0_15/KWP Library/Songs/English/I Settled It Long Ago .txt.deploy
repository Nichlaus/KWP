 There was a time on earth,when in the books of heaven An old account was standing for Sins yet unforgiven My name was at the top,with many things below I Went to the Keeper and I settled long ago CHORUS Long ago (down on my knees) Long ago (I settled it all) Yes the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah And the record is clear today,for He washed my sins away When the old account was settled long ago. The old account was large and growing every day For I was always sinning and I never tried to pray, But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe I said that I would settle,and I settled long ago. CHORUS Long ago (down on my knees) Long ago (I settled it all) Yes the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah And the record is clear today,for He washed my sins away When the old account was settled long ago. When at the judgement seat,I stand before my King And there the Books will open,He cannot find a thing, Then will my heart be glad,and tears of joy will flow Because I had it settled,and I settled long ago. CHORUS Long ago (down on my knees) Long ago (I settled it all) Yes the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah And the record is clear today,for He washed my sins away When the old account was settled long ago. When in that happy home,my Saviour's home above, I'll sing redemption story,and praise Him for His love; I'll not forget that Book,with pages white as snow Because I came and settled,when I settled long ago. CHORUS Long ago (down on my knees) Long ago (I settled it all) Yes the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah And the record is clear today,for He washed my sins away When the old account was settled long ago. Oh,sinners seek ye the Lord,repent of all your sins, For this He has commanded if you should enter in, And then if you should live,a thousand years here below You'll never regret it,why you settled long ago. CHORUS Long ago (down on my knees) Long ago (I settled it all) Yes the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah And the record is clear today,for He washed my sins away When the old account was settled long ago.
