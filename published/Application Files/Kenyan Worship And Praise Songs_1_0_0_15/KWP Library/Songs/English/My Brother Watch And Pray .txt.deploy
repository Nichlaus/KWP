 The scene now is setting, The time is drawing nigh, When the Lord said He's coming Like a thief in the night; He wants us to get ready It may be just any day For the Master now is waiting For the bride to watch and pray. CHORUS Watch and pray the Lord is coming, Watch and pray; He's waiting for His children to get desperate and say Oh Jesus please come quickly For there is no other way For the spirit now is calling, Oh my brother watch and pray. The message has been given Elijah now is gone We are waiting for the secret catching of the Bride away It may be any moment In the morning, night or noon But the Bridegroom is just waiting For the bride to watch and pray. CHORUS Watch and pray the Lord is coming, Watch and pray; He's waiting for His children to get desperate and say Oh Jesus please come quickly For there is no other way For the spirit now is calling, Oh my brother watch and pray.
