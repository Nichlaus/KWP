 When salvation story,ends in heaven's glory And by sight I witness What my Lord has done, Helping me surrender, by His love so tender Giving me a mansion,far beyond the sun. CHORUS Far beyond the sun Far beyond the sun, Far beyond the sun, I have a home,a beautiful home, Far beyond the sun. Unto every nation,full of free salvation, God so freely offered Through His precious Son Soon shall come the dawning,of that happy morning, When the Lord shall take us, far beyond the sun. CHORUS Far beyond the sun Far beyond the sun, Far beyond the sun, I have a home,a beautiful home, Far beyond the sun.
