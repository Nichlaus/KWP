Courage, brother, do not stumble,Though thy path be dark as night;Thereâ€™s a star to guide the humble:Trust in God and do the right.Let the road be rough and dreary,And its end far out of sight,Foot it bravely; strong or weary.[Refrain]Trust in God, trust in God,Trust in God and do the right.Perish policy and cunning,Perish all that fears the light!Whether losing, whether winning,Trust in God and do the right.Trust no party, sect, or faction;Trust no leaders in the fight;Put in every word or action.Some will hate thee, some will love thee,Some will flatter, some will slight;Cease from man, and look above thee:Trust in God and do the right.Simple rule, and safest guiding,Inward peace and inward might,Star upon our path abiding.
