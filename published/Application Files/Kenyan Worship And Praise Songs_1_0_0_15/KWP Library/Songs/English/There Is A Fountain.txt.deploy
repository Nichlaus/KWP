There is a fountain filled with blood,Drawn from Emmanuel's veins,And sinners plunged beneath that flood,Lose all their guilty stains.Lose all their guilty stains,Lose all there guilty stains;And sinners plunged beneath that flood,Lose all their guilty stains.The dying thief rejoiced to seeThat fountain in his day;And there may I,though as vile as he,Wash all my sins away.Wash all my sins away,Wash all my sins away,And there may I,though as vile as he,Wash all my sins away.Thou dying lamb,Thy precious bloodShall never lose its power,Till all the ransomed church of GodBe saved, to sin no more.Be saved, to sin no more,Be saved, to sin no more;Till all the ransomed church of GodBe saved to sin no more.E'er since by faith I saw the streamThy flowing wounds supply,Redeeming love has been my theme,And shall be till I die.And shall be till I die,And shall be till I die;Redeeming love has been my theme,And shall be till I die.Then in a nobler,sweeter song,I'll sing Thy power to save,When this poor lisping,stammering tongueLies silent in the grave.Lies silent in the grave,Lies silent in the grave;When this poor lisping,stammering tongueLies silent in the grave.
