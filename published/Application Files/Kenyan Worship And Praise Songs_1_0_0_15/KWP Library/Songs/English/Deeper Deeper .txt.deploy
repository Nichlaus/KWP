 Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus Daily let me go; Higher, higher in the school of wisdom, More of grace to know. CHORUS Oh deeper yet, I pray, And higher every day, And wiser blessed Lord, In Thy precious Holy Word. Deeper, deeper blessed Holy Spirit, Take me deeper still, Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus, And His perfect will. CHORUS Oh deeper yet, I pray, And higher every day, And wiser blessed Lord, In Thy precious Holy Word. Deeper, deeper tho it cost hard trials, Deeper let me go! Rooted in the holy love of Jesus, Let me fruitful grow. CHORUS Oh deeper yet, I pray, And higher every day, And wiser blessed Lord, In Thy precious Holy Word. Deeper, higher every day in Jesus, Till all conflict past, Finds me conqueror and in His own image, Perfected at last. CHORUS Oh deeper yet, I pray, And higher every day, And wiser blessed Lord, In Thy precious Holy Word.
