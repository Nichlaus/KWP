 In these days of trials so near the end, When Christ from Glory doth now descend, Men's hearts are failing and filled with fear, We know the end time is surely here. CHORUS So just be faithful, believe His Word; Stay with the Message that you have heard; List' to His prophet, his Message heed; Walk in the Light where His star doth lead. In every church age a star did shine, To help God's people a Truth to find; In this last church age a star shines bright, So friend receive It, walk in the Light. CHORUS So just be faithful, believe His Word; Stay with the Message that you have heard; List' to His prophet, his Message heed; Walk in the Light where His star doth lead. Do not be fearful or filled with dread, Your prophet sleepeth, he is not dead; The Bride is waiting now for that Voice, And in this hope we can now rejoice. CHORUS So just be faithful, believe His Word; Stay with the Message that you have heard; List' to His prophet, his Message heed; Walk in the Light where His star doth lead. His Word of promise he gave the Bride, From his White Charger the prophet cried, Yet one more time shall I ride this trail THUS SAITH THE LORD can never fail. CHORUS So just be faithful, believe His Word; Stay with the Message that you have heard; List' to His prophet, his Message heed; Walk in the Light where His star doth lead.
