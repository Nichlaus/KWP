 There's three kinds of believers In this world today, They gather where the eagles go to feed, Their lives are so shabby And darkened with the world, They're blind and they cannot see their need. CHORUS Oh we say we're Believers Since we believe all the Word, Our works are both great and small; But If this same Life's not living through you, Then you're not even called to at all. God's Wife is an Army, Marching through the land; Destroying everything in Her way. There's many make-Believers Who fight by her side. But when they have fallen, She just leaves them lay. CHORUS Oh we say we're Believers Since we believe all the Word, Our works are both great and small; But If this same Life's not living through you, Then you're not even called to at all. The true Elect of God Have died to themselves, They have all heard the Evening call! They know that the Token Must be displayed, Or they're not even called to at all! CHORUS Oh we say we're Believers Since we believe all the Word, Our works are both great and small; But If this same Life's not living through you, Then you're not even called to at all.
