 I am now on the altar, I am now on the altar, I am now on the altar Which was made for me. CHORUS Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, For He sets me free! I will never doubt my Saviour, I will never doubt my Saviour, I will never doubt my Saviour, For He cleanses me. CHORUS Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, For He sets me free! I will rest on His promise, I will rest on His promise, I will rest on His promise, Which is given to me. CHORUS Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, For He sets me free! On the other side of Jordon, In the sweet fields of Eden Where the Tree of Life is blooming, There is rest for me. CHORUS Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, Jesus breaks every fetter, For He sets me free! (I will ever, ever praise Him ...) (I will give God the glory ...) (I will shout Hallelujah ...)
