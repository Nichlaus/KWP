 I just want to thank you Lord For letting me hear your word What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me Thanks for that special night When I saw your glorious light Came face to face with eternal life Lord I thank thee You didn't have to open my eyes You could have easily passed me by For the age I was living in , was wretched poor and blind Then I heard recognizing your day Serpent seed and Perfect faith The Breach and the message of Grace Lord I thank thee Not even in my wildest dreams Did I think I would see such things, As the Coming of the Lord The Rapture Mystery I have Heard but Now I see God in simplicity The spoken Word is the Original Seed And Lord I thank thee
