 What a wonderful beautiful picture I have Of a place without sorrow or fear And I am going to live in a city somewhere Cause my days are all numbered down here. CHORUS My Lord keeps a record of the moment. I am living down here (x2) He knows all about me All my troubles, my sorrows my fears (x2) I am living (every moment)x2 Through the mercies of (God's loving grace)x2 Some day He will call me To that wonderful beautiful place. I want to be doing the will of my Lord As I travel this wearisome land So I'll not be ashamed of my record up there, As I stand at my Saviour's right hand. CHORUS My Lord keeps a record of the moment. I am living down here (x2) He knows all about me All my troubles, my sorrows my fears (x2) I am living (every moment)x2 Through the mercies of (God's loving grace)x2 Some day He will call me To that wonderful beautiful place.
