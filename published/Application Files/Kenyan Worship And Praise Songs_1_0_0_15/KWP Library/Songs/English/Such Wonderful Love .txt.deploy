 Oh the right road I've travelled Since Jesus came in Took away all my sins, He gladly bore the shame When they nailed Him to the cross He never counted the cost Praise the Lord,Hallelujah Oh that love He had for us. CHORUS Such love,such wonderful love, I was lost,condemned to die, When He reached down His hand for me He took my place at Calvary. When they stood all around Him, And accused Him of sin, They mocked Him and smote Him And cursed His holy Name. Yet He stood there like a lamb Not one word to defend; Praise the Lord, Hallelujah, All glory to the Lamb. CHORUS Such love,such wonderful love, I was lost,condemned to die, When He reached down His hand for me He took my place at Calvary.
