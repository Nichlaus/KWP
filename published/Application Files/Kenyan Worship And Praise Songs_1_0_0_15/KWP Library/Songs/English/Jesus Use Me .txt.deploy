 Dear Lord I will be a witness If you will help my weakness I know that I am not worthy Lord of Thee By eyes of faith I see Thee Upon the cross of Calvary, Dear Lord I pray let me Thy servant be. CHORUS Jesus use me,Oh Lord and don't refuse , For surely there's a work that I can do, And even though it Is humble Help my will to crumble Though the cost be great I will work for you. He is the Lily of the Valley, The bright and Morning Star He is the fairest of ten thousands to my soul He is the beautiful Rose of Sharon He is all in all to me And most of all He is my coming King. CHORUS Jesus use me,Oh Lord and don't refuse , For surely there's a work that I can do, And even though it Is humble Help my will to crumble Though the cost be great I will work for you.
