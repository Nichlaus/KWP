 He could have walked away But the price He chose to pay And as He looked ahead in time I have no doubt you crossed His mind When He heard you Pilate say To the hill take Him away There He paid sin's awful cost With His back to the cross. CHORUS When your back is to the wall Remember His was to the cross The grave lost its victory And old man death, where's your sting? When God gave His only son Your every battle then was won So when your back is to the wall Remember His was to the cross. When your tears fall like rain And you lose more than you gain If in your life there is no song When all you need the most is gone When all is said and done You've not lost, but you've won So when your back is to the wall Remember His was to the cross. CHORUS When your back is to the wall Remember His was to the cross The grave lost its victory And old man death, where's your sting? When God gave His only son Your every battle then was won So when your back is to the wall Remember His was to the cross.
