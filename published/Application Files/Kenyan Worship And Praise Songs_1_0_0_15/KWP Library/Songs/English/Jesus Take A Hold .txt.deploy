 Lord, I know I've failed you,as I struggle on And I keep getting weaker, I need someone that's strong Oh so reach down once again Lord, as I go on my knees While I'm still holding on, And hold on to me. CHORUS Jesus take a hold, and hold on to me I'm the weakest of your children Oh how I need Thee... And if I should make it thru the only way it will be Is that Jesus take a hold, and hold on to me. Sometimes I feel unworthy, Sometimes I feel ashamed, Cause I can't offer more To glorify Thy name; Lord I need to see your presence, Oh how I need Thee So Jesus take a hold, And hold on to me. CHORUS Jesus take a hold, and hold on to me I'm the weakest of your children Oh how I need Thee... And if I should make it thru the only way it will be Is that Jesus take a hold, and hold on to me.
