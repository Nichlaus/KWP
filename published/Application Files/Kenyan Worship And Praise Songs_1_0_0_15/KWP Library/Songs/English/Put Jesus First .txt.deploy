 Put Jesus first He'll take care of you He said He'd stand beside me Watch over and guide me If I would only put Him first in my life I feel the calm assurance in each task I do Put Jesus first He'll take care of you. CHORUS Put Jesus first in all that you do Put Jesus first He'll take care of you Won't worry about tomorrow With all its pain and sorrow Put Jesus first He'll take care of you. Let not my heart be troubled He said He'd share of my burdens If I would only put Him first in my life Just put your trust in Jesus,In all that you do, Put Jesus first,He'll take care of you. CHORUS Put Jesus first in all that you do Put Jesus first He'll take care of you Won't worry about tomorrow With all its pain and sorrow Put Jesus first He'll take care of you.
