 As I wondered today neath the setting sun I dreamed of days long ago And it seemed I was travellinghome once more With loved ones I used to know. CHORUS At sundown I'm going home At sundown no more to roam Sweet voices are calling,calling me And I'm going home at sundown. SPOKEN WORDS. The time has come now For the sun of my life is sinking low My steps are not as fast as before But I know my loved ones are waiting To welcome me home once more. Just like a child I used to go home When the day was done, How I'm longing for the last time Because it is sundown. CHORUS At sundown I'm going home At sundown no more to roam Sweet voices are calling,calling me And I'm going home at sundown. SPOKEN WORDS. The time has come now For the sun of my life is sinking low My steps are not as fast as before But I know my loved ones are waiting To welcome me home once more.
