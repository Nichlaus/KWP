 There are people almost everywhere, Whose hearts are all aflame With the fire that fell at Pentecost, Which cleansed and made them clean; It is burning now within my heart, All glory to His name! I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. CHORUS One of them, one of them. I am glad that I can say I'm one of them; One of them, one of them, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Though these people may not learned be, Nor boast of Worldly fame, They have all received their Pentecost, Baptized in Jesus' name; And are telling now, both far and wide, His power is yet the same, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. CHORUS One of them, one of them. I am glad that I can say I'm one of them; One of them, one of them, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. They were gathered in the upper room, All praying in His name, They were baptized with the Holy Ghost, And pow'r for service came; Now what He did for them that day He'll do for you the same, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. CHORUS One of them, one of them. I am glad that I can say I'm one of them; One of them, one of them, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Come, my brother, seek this blessing That will cleanse your heart from sin, That will start the joy-bells ringing And will keep the soul aflame: It is burning now within my heart, All glory to His name, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. CHORUS One of them, one of them. I am glad that I can say I'm one of them; One of them, one of them, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
