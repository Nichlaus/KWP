 CHORUS I love the thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people x 2 What a sight just to see all the happy faces, Praising the Lord in the heavenly places What a thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people. Oh what joy His love affords When we meet in one accord And we lift our hands in praises unto the Lord There is no place I'd rather be Than with ones who've been set free I'm so glad that I'm in God's big family. CHORUS I love the thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people x 2 What a sight just to see all the happy faces, Praising the Lord in the heavenly places What a thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people. Now it can be just anywhere Two or three are gathered there That the Spirit of the Lord will be there too There's no fellowship so sweet There's no thrill that can compare With the thrill I feel whenever God's people meet. CHORUS I love the thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people x 2 What a sight just to see all the happy faces, Praising the Lord in the heavenly places What a thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people. On that great reunion day When the Lord says come away And the saints from every land Will sweep through the gate Joining loved ones round the Throne As we'll all be gathered home That will be the greatest thrill We've never known. CHORUS I love the thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people x 2 What a sight just to see all the happy faces, Praising the Lord in the heavenly places What a thrill that I feel when I get together With God's wonderful people.
