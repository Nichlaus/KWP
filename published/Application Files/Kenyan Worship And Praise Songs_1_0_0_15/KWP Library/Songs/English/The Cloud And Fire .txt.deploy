 As of old, when the hosts of Israel Were compelled in the wilderness to dwell, Trusting they in their God to lead the way To the light of perfect day. CHORUS So the sign of the fire by night, And the sign of the cloud by day, Hovering over, just before, As they journey on their way, Shall a guide and a leader be, Till the wilderness be past. For the Lord, our God, in His own good time Shall lead to the light at last. To and fro, as a ship without a sail, Not a compass to guide them through the vale, But the sign of their God was ever near, Thus their fainting hearts to cheer. CHORUS So the sign of the fire by night, And the sign of the cloud by day, Hovering over, just before, As they journey on their way, Shall a guide and a leader be, Till the wilderness be past. For the Lord, our God, in His own good time Shall lead to the light at last. All the days of their wanderings they were fed. To the land of the promise they were led; By the hand of the Lord in guidance sure, They were brought to Canaan's shore. CHORUS So the sign of the fire by night, And the sign of the cloud by day, Hovering over, just before, As they journey on their way, Shall a guide and a leader be, Till the wilderness be past. For the Lord, our God, in His own good time Shall lead to the light at last.
