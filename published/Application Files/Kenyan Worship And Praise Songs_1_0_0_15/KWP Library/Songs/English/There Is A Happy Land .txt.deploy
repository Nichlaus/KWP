 There is a happy land, Far, far, away Where saints in glory stand, Bright, bright as day Oh how sweetly they sing Worthy is our Saviour King! Loud let His praises ring Praise, praise for aye. Come to this happy land Come, come away; Why will ye doubting stand? Why still delay? Oh we shall happy be, When, from sin and sorrow free, Lord, we shall live with Thee Blest, blest for aye. Bright in that happy land Beams e'very eye Kept by a father^s hand Love cannot die; On,then,to glory run; Be a crown and kingdom won; And,bright above the sun, Reign,reign for aye.
