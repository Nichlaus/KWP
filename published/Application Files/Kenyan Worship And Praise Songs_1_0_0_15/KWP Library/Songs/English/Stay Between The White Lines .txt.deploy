 I remember when I was a little child Down on an old country farm Wed go to church on Sunday And Id hear the preacher say If you want to see my Jesus Youve gotta stay on the Kings highway This highway leads to glory And its no easy ride Youll find all kinds of exits Theyll throw you off your stride Some will lead to fortune And other lead to fame Some will lead you so far off You wont return again Oh you just stay between the white lines Obey all the right signs Keep your eyes opened all the time Oh you just stay between the white lines An youll get to heaven right on time Satans on this highway He walks on every side Trying to flag you down Dont give him a ride He will try and stop you At just any sign You may stop too long And you soul my be lost
