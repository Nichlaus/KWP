 My Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign; My Gracious Redeemer, My Saviour art Thou, If ever I loved Thee,My Jesus, ^tis now. I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me, And purchased my pardon when nailed to the tree, I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow, If ever I loved Thee, My Jesus,'tis now. I will love Thee in life,I will love Thee in death, And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath; And say, when the death-dew lies cold on my brow, If ever I loved Thee,My Jesus, 'tis now.
