 I can see the sun going down My time down here will soon be over I will hear the angels sing When I reach the golden shore. CHORUS Don't weep, for me When they take me to my resting place I'll shout and sing When I see my Saviour's face. Soon the stones will be rolled away, And the graves will open wide We'll take our flight on angels' wings And there with Jesus we'll abide. CHORUS Don't weep, for me When they take me to my resting place I'll shout and sing When I see my Saviour's face. Don't you weep when am crossing Jordan For you won't have too long to wait You'll be coming on some bright morning And I'll meet you at the Eastern gate. CHORUS Don't weep, for me When they take me to my resting place I'll shout and sing When I see my Saviour's face.
