 Wretched and poor,I once was living, Imprisoned by Satan imprisoned by death, But Christ my Saviour,came down from glory And changed my poor wretched soul And now I am free. CHORUS Back in Eden, I'll be free from all sin I'll be free from all evil I'll be free from all fears Tempted and tried each moment of life All these have not moved me they cannot change me When in the Spirit I walk all day long And lean on my Saviour who conquered the grave. CHORUS Back in Eden, I'll be free from all sin I'll be free from all evil I'll be free from all fears Jesus my Lord,died long to save you, And yet in sin you toil each moment of your Life. You will answer for it,beyond the river, When you meet your Maker the Spirit you grieve. CHORUS Back in Eden, I'll be free from all sin I'll be free from all evil I'll be free from all fears Saints and angels above are singing They're waiting for us beyond the river And when we're raised,we'll join the Lord's band And sing to our Saviour, Hallelujah,Amen! CHORUS Back in Eden, I'll be free from all sin I'll be free from all evil I'll be free from all fears Hallelujah Amen! Hallelujah Amen! Hallelujah,hallelujah, Hallelujah,Amen! CHORUS Back in Eden, I^ll be free from all sin I^ll be free from all evil I^ll be free from all fears
