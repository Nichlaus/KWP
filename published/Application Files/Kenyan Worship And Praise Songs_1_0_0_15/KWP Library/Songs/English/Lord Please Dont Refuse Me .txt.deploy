 Oh Lord I've been so selfish In my work for you I haven't been the way You'd have me be But now I come repenting Of my self-centred ways; And from now on My life I'll live for Thee. CHORUS Jesus use me, Oh Lord please don't refuse me; Surely there's a work that I can do, And even though I stumble, Help my will to crumble. Though the cost be great I'll work for you. There's many things to do Lord They may be great or small; Whatever you want done Please let me do. I know there I'll be rewards Lord, When at the judgement bar If only here I stand and work for you.  CHORUS  Jesus use me,  Oh Lord please don't refuse me;  Surely there's a work that I can do,  And even though I stumble,  Help my will to crumble.  Though the cost be great  I'll work for you.
