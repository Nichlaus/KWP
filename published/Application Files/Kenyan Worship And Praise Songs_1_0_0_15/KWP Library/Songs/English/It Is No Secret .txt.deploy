 It is no secret what God can do; What He's done for others, He'll do for you. With arms wide open, He'll pardon you, It is no secret what God can do. It is no secret, I believe the Word; My eyes were opened, my heart was stirred. I recognized him the first I heard The prophet bring us the SPOKEN WORD. It is no secret where I have been; I met the prophet and he took me in. With my heart wide open, the Light shone in. It is no secret I follow him. It is no secret of who he is, More than a prophet, I'm convinced of this: The seventh angel, the son of man, The Elijah promised in God's great plan.
