Onward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of Jesus,Going on before,Christ the royal Master,Leads against the foe;Forward into battle,See, His banners go!CHORUSOnward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of JesusGoing on before.Like a mighty armyMoves the Church of God;Brothers, we are treading,Where the saints have trod;We are not divided,All one body we;One in hope and doctrine,One in charity.CHORUSOnward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of JesusGoing on before.Crowns and thrones may perish,Kingdoms rise and wane;But the church of JesusConstant will remain;Gates of hell can never'Gainst that Church prevail;We have Christ's Own promise,Which can never fail.CHORUSOnward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of JesusGoing on before.At the sign of triumph,Satan's host doth flee;Oh, then, Christian soldiers,On to victory!Hell's foundations quiverAt the shout of praise;Brothers, lift your voices,Loud your anthems raise!CHORUSOnward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of JesusGoing on before.Onward, then ye people!Join our happy throng;Blend with ours your voicesIn the triumph song;Glory, laud, and honour,Unto Christ the King;This through countless agesMen and angels sing.CHORUSOnward, Christian Soldiers!Marching as to war,With the cross of JesusGoing on before.
