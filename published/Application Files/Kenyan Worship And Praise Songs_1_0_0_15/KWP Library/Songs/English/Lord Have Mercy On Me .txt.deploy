 This world has fame this world has fortune This world has plenty of popularity How many a man has lived therein Gone through life and died in sin. CHORUS Oh Lord have mercy,have mercy on me I want to stand in Thy righteousness Lord hear my cry I'm trusting now In Thee But for grace It could have been me. Many sad things I have heard Of children dying in the streets No one to care for them But the saddest thing I've ever seen Is of a man having lived in sin And dying without God. CHORUS Oh Lord have mercy,have mercy on me I want to stand in Thy righteousness Lord hear my cry I'm trusting now In Thee But for grace It could have been me.
