 CHORUS You've got to stand and believe For the things you've been praying Stand and believe No matter what the world is saying You can have what you ask If you ask Him believing You will surely receive, When you stand and believe. If there is a mountain standing in your way, You can remove it if you know just what to say He gave you power,you can live above this world If you stand upon the word,and believe just what He says. CHORUS You've got to stand and believe For the things you've been praying Stand and believe No matter what the world is saying You can have what you ask If you ask Him believing You will surely receive, When you stand and believe. If you need healing for your body or your soul Just call on Jesus He will surely make you whole Don't trust your feelings,you got to stand upon the Word And speak of all those things that are not as though they are. CHORUS You've got to stand and believe For the things you've been praying Stand and believe No matter what the world is saying You can have what you ask If you ask Him believing You will surely receive, When you stand and believe.
