 O land of rest, for thee I sigh! When will the moment come When I shall lay my armor by, And dwell in peace at home? CHORUS We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, And we'll be gathered home! To Jesus Christ I fled for rest; He bade me cease to roam; And lean for succor on His breast Till He conduct me home? CHORUS We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, And we'll be gathered home! I sought at once my Saviour's side, No more my steps shall roam; With Him I'll brave death's chilling tide And reach my heavenly home. CHORUS We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, We'll work till Jesus comes, And we'll be gathered home!
