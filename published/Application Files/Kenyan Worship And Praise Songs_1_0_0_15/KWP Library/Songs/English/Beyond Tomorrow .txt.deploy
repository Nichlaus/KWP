 I long to gain my treasures waiting, Up on the other shore, Beyond tomorrow, Beyond tomorrow, A land without a heavy burden; Where dear ones for us wait, Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow. CHORUS Beyond tomorrow My skies will all be blue Beyond tomorrow My dreams come true There'll be no sorrow Beyond tomorrow For Christ will be with me Throughout eternity. A starry crown and robes of glory, Are waiting there for me, Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow But most of all the face of Jesus Is what I want to see, Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow. CHORUS Beyond tomorrow My skies will all be blue Beyond tomorrow My dreams come true There'll be no sorrow Beyond tomorrow For Christ will be with me Throughout eternity. Just over chilly Jordan river, Inside the pearly gates, Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow A land without a heavy burden Where dear ones for us wait, Beyond tomorrow, beyond tomorrow. CHORUS Beyond tomorrow My skies will all be blue Beyond tomorrow My dreams come true There'll be no sorrow Beyond tomorrow For Christ will be with me Throughout eternity.
