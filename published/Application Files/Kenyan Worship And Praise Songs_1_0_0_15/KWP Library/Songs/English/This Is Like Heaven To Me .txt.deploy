 We find many people who can^t understand Why we are so happy and free; We^ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land And this is like Heaven to me. CHORUS Oh, this is like Heaven to me,(Praise God!) Yes, this is like Heaven to me; I^ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land, And this is like Heaven to me. Oh, when I get happy, I sing and I shout, The devil don't believe It, I see; But I'm filled with the Spirit, there isn't a doubt, And that,s what's the matter with me. CHORUS Oh, this is like Heaven to me,(Praise God!) Yes, this is like Heaven to me; I've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land, And this is like Heaven to me. CHORUS Oh, this is like Heaven to me,(Praise God!) Yes, this is like Heaven to me; I've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land, And this is like Heaven to me. We've heard the sweet music, the heavenly chord From glory land over the sea; A soul-thrilling message from Jesus our Lord, And this is like heaven to me. CHORUS Oh, this is like Heaven to me,(Praise God!) Yes, this is like Heaven to me; I've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land, And this is like Heaven to me.
