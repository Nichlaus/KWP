 In robes made white through Jesus blood We soon shall meet beyond the flood, And hold sweet converse free from pain And never fear to part again, Beyond the swelling flood. CHORUS Beyond the swelling flood. Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to pait no more We'll meet to part no more Beyond the swelling flood In fear not now that ills may come By faith I see that heavenly home And hear the angels voices say 'Thy God shall wipe all tears away. Beyond the swelling flood. CHORUS Beyond the swelling flood. Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to pait no more We'll meet to part no more Beyond the swelling flood Oh meeting blest with friends so dear What sound shall greet the listening ear What shouts of rapture wake the soul As back those golden gates shall roll, Beyond the swelling flood. CHORUS Beyond the swelling flood. Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to pait no more We'll meet to part no more Beyond the swelling flood Dear Saviour guide my willing feet, That I may have that joy complete That I may praise through endless day The love that dries all tears away, Beyond the swelling flood. CHORUS Beyond the swelling flood. Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood Beyond the swelling flood We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to part no more We'll meet to pait no more We'll meet to part no more Beyond the swelling flood.
