 The sun, it will never go down, in that city, The sun, it will never go down; The flowers are blooming forever, And the sun, it will never go down. I feel like traveling on, I do, I feel like traveling on; The flowers are blooming forever, And the sun, it will never go down. If feel like shouting, sometimes I do, I feel like shouting, I do; The flowers are blooming forever, And the sun, it will never go down.
