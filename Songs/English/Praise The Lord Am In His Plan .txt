 Praise the Lord, He knows my name All that I have is His to control Praise the Lord am in His plan. He knew me before I knew Him He knew just what I'll go through He wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life Praise the Lord, am in His plan. He had a good plan of my life Before I thought of having one He took me out of denominational chains Praise the Lord am in His plan. Praise the Lord, I am in His plan No matter what may come on my way With the world falling He'll hide me in His land Praise the Lord, am in His plan.
