 I walk with God through long years Through plains and floods Through pain and fear I follow Him His voice obeying I am nearer home than I was yesterday. CHORUS I am nearer home than I was yesterday I am closer to God along the way Each day by day each prayer I pray I am nearer home than I was yesterday. The bleeding clouds that sweeps the sky The whispering wind that chills the ships The night the crisping sun all speak and say I am nearer home than I was yesterday CHORUS I am nearer home than I was yesterday I am closer to God along the way Each day by day each prayer I pray I am nearer home than I was yesterday.
