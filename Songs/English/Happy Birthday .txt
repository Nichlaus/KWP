 I've been born into the family of Jesus my King The church (bride) is the circle of His wedding ring To the Kingship's marriage forever to be And the angels up in heaven sang, Happy Birthday to me. CHORUS I've been born by the spirit And made part of the Bride Saved by the blood that flowed From His precious side, In sin I was blinded but now I can see And the angels up in heaven sang Happy Birthday to me. I've a home up in heaven Where there'll be no more nights By the birth of my Saviour I must see the light There I'll sit by the river By the waters from the stream And hear the angels singing Happy Birthday to me. CHORUS I've been born by the spirit And made part of the Bride Saved by the blood that flowed From His precious side, In sin I was blinded but now I can see And the angels up in heaven sang Happy Birthday to me.
