 Listen my friend to these words of mine, There is an answer to every problem you^ll find, They're found in the Bible the true Word of God, In there is Eternal Life to all that believe, CHORUS God's Word Is true,He will never fail you, If you'll walk in the Light,He'll see you through, Like all of God's prophets that before us have been, This prophets fulfilled the words that were written of him. There is a promise to us in this day, That a mighty prophet is to come our way, And we find this promise in Malachi 4, And we must believe it so that God can restore. CHORUS God's Word Is true,He will never fail you, If you'll walk in the Light,He'll see you through, Like all of God's prophets that before us have been, This prophets fulfilled the words that were written of him.
