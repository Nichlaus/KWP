 When the world seems so cold And your friends seem far There is someone who cares for you When tears are in your eyes Your heart bleeds inside There is someone who cares for you. CHORUS Someone who cares, someone to share All your troubles like no other can do He will come down from the skies And brush the tears from your eyes You are His child and He cares for you. When your disappointments come And you feel so blue There is someone who cares for you When you need a friend a friend till the end There is someone who is a friend to you. CHORUS Someone who cares, someone to share All your troubles like no other can do He will come down from the skies And brush the tears from your eyes You are His child and He cares for you.
