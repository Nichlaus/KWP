 CHORUS Let the Lord have His way, Let the Lord have His way, Put your hand In His hand and let Him lead, Look up high and see a crown awaiting over there, And let the Lord, Oh let the Lord have His way. When the road seems so rough And the valleys so low, And the mountains so high you cannot climb Cast your care upon the Lord He will clear the way for you So let the Lord, so let the Lord Have His way. CHORUS Let the Lord have His way, Let the Lord have His way, Put your hand In His hand and let Him lead, Look up high and see a crown awaiting over there, And let the Lord, Oh let the Lord have His way. When I think of men of old, I think of Noah a man of God When he was told to build an ark by the Lord This he did without complaint And so was saved from the flood, Because he let, He let the Lord have His way. CHORUS Let the Lord have His way, Let the Lord have His way, Put your hand In His hand and let Him lead, Look up high and see a crown awaiting over there, And let the Lord, Oh let the Lord have His way.
