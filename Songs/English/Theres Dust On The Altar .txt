 Children are scattered all over the land Weve lost our love for our fellow man Fathers and mothers are parted today Theres dust on the altar where we used to pray CHORUS Our children are crying and dying in sin Satan is laughing as Gods people stray Theres dust on the altar where we used to pray Tears that were once shed for a brother in need Are now called old fashioned, theyre no longer seen, Greed and proud hearts have gotten in the way Theres dust on the altar where we used to pray CHORUS Our children are crying and dying in sin Satan is laughing as Gods people stray Theres dust on the altar where we used to pray.
