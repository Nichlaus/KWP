 Jesus I know, I've neglected to do The little things or big things You've wanted me to do I've let you down Jesus,but not all just this Jesus, Oh Jesus, don't give up on me. CHORUS Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow If there's any hope left don't leave me now I might be worth saving I'm trying to be Jesus Oh Jesus, don't give up on me. It's late I know, and I've made you wait But don't turn the light out Don't close the door Forgiveness, and patience,that's all I need Jesus, Oh Jesus,don't give up on me. CHORUS Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow If there's any hope left don't leave me now I might be worth saving I'm trying to be Jesus Oh Jesus, don't give up on me.
