 It was not the nails that held Our Lord to the cross, It was His love for you and me, The crown of thorns He did not have to bear But for love He went to Calvary. CHORUS And when that old rugged cross Attains the goal, And the face of the Saviour we'll behold It will be worth everything When we will see the King And hear Him say,my child well done! On that old rugged cross He paid the price for you and me Oh such love the world has never known And by His love and by His grace We shall look upon His face And hear Him say,my child well done! CHORUS And when that old rugged cross Attains the goal, And the face of the Saviour we'll behold It will be worth everything When we will see the King And hear Him say,my child well done!
