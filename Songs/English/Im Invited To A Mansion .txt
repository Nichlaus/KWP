 I've heard people talk about heaven, And describe it's beauties so real; So one day I purchased a title For a mansion in that city so fair Twas given to me without money But it cost my dear Saviour His life; He died on the cross without a murmur For me He paid the great price. CHORUS I'm Invited to a mansion In glory, That Jesus has gone to prepare, Fire cannot touch It, thieves cannot harm it, And it never will need a repair The termites can^t mar it's foundation For on the Rock of Ages it stands I feel it is almost completed, And ready for me to move In. My evil deeds were all forgiven By the Rock of Ages my Lord; And my name was engraved in gold letters, In tha Lamb's Book of Life, safe within I'm an heir to a mansion in glory Where from this life I shall go I'm waiting for Jesus to call me, Then I'll lay down my cross and go home. CHORUS I'm Invited to a mansion In glory, That Jesus has gone to prepare, Fire cannot touch It, thieves cannot harm it, And it never will need a repair The termites can't mar it's foundation For on the Rock of Ages it stands I feel it is almost completed, And ready for me to move In.
