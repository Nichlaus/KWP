My soul in sad exile was out on life^s sea,So burdened with sin and distressed,Till I heard a sweet voice saying,Make Me your choice;And I entered the haven of Rest!CHORUSI've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,I'll sail the wild seas no more;The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,In Jesus I'm safe evermore.I yielded myself to His tender embrace,And faith taking hold of the Word,My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul;The Haven of Rest is my Lord.CHORUSI've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,I'll sail the wild seas no more;The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,In Jesus I'm safe evermore.The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,Has been the old story, so blest,Of Jesus, who'll save whosoever will haveA home in the Haven of Rest!CHORUSI've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,I'll sail the wild seas no more;The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,In Jesus I'm safe evermore.How precious the thought that we all may recline,Like John, the beloved and blest,On Jesus' strong arm, where no tempest can harm.Secure in the Haven of Rest!CHORUSI've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,I'll sail the wild seas no more;The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,In Jesus I'm safe evermore.O come to the Saviour,He patiently waitsTo save by His power divine;Come, anchor your soul in the haven of rest,And say, My Beloved is mine.CHORUSI've anchored my soul in the haven of rest,I'll sail the wild seas no more;The tempest may sweep o'er the wild, stormy deep,In Jesus I'm safe evermore.
