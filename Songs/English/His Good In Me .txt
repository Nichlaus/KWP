 I have spent all the money I ever owned I have squandered all my talents,there's nothing to show But now I gladly come just as I am to Jesus And I pray He'd create His good in me. CHORUS But maybe He can make something of me Oooh... I know I'm not as smart Like someone else, I don't pretend to be But this one thing I know for sure My old wretched soul won't find its cure Till He has been lifted in me. This old flesh I wear gets so hard to bear And is sometimes weak My forgetful mind just won't let me find The words to speak And everyday old Satan tells me That there's no need to believe That He could ever make something of me. CHORUS But maybe He can make something of me Oooh... I know I'm not as smart Like someone else, I don't pretend to be But this one thing I know for sure My old wretched soul won't find its cure Till He has been lifted in me. ...But this one thing l know for sure My old wretched soul has found its cure For He has made His good in me. CHORUS But maybe He can make something of me Oooh... I know I'm not as smart Like someone else, I don't pretend to be But this one thing I know for sure My old wretched soul won't find its cure Till He has been lifted in me.
