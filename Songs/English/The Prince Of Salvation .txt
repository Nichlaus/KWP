 Just when my life was drifting Jesus came along, With His loving arms of mercy Made my weakened body strong With His Power I'm now rejoicing, His Spirit made this sinner new, He touched me and He can touch you too. CHORUS He's the Prince of Salvation The Master of your soul, And He's there just for the asking, To cleanse and make you whole, So If you're lost in darkness, There's a Lighthouse for you, He touched me and He can touch you too. When the trials of life seem heavy, Just remember Calvary's road, And the way He must have suffered, Yet He still helps with each load So keep your hearts door open, And let my Jesus walk through He touched me and He can touch you too. CHORUS He's the Prince of Salvation The Master of your soul, And He's there just for the asking, To cleanse and make you whole, So If you're lost in darkness, There's a Lighthouse for you, He touched me and He can touch you too.
