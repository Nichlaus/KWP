 Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, Calling for you and for me, See on the portals He's waiting and watching, Watching for you and for me. CHORUS Come home, come home, Ye who are wary, come home; Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home! Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, Pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and head not His mercies, Mercies for you and for me? CHORUS Come home, come home, Ye who are wary, come home; Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home! Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing, Passing from you and from me; Shadows are gathering, death's night is coming, Coming for you and for me. CHORUS Come home, come home, Ye who are wary, come home; Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home! Oh! For the wonderful love He has promised, Promised for you and for me; Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon, Pardon for you and for me. CHORUS Come home, come home, Ye who are wary, come home; Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home!
