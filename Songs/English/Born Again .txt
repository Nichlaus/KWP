 CHORUS Born again, free from sin, I am happy now I am saved Praise to God there's no doubt I know I am born again. They do tell me that I always thought I got saved They tell me what a fool I have been, But when my mind goes back to God Oh it seems well I know that I have been born again. CHORUS Born again, free from sin, I am happy now I am saved Praise to God there's no doubt I know I am born again. Many times along the way my faith has grown weak When burdens seem to rise on every hand But when I see the way and that He answers my pleas My every plea He understands. CHORUS Born again, free from sin, I am happy now I am saved Praise to God there's no doubt I know I am born again
