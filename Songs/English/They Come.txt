They come from the east and west,They comes from the lands afar,To feast with the King, to dine as His guest;How blessed these pilgrims are!Beholding His hallowed faceAglow with light divine;Blest partakers of His grace,As germs in His crown to shine.CHORUSSince Jesus has set me free,I'm happy as heart can be;No longer I bear the burden of care,His yoke is so sweet to me,My soul was as black as night,But darkness has taken flight;Now I shout the victory,For Jesus has set me free.I look on the great white throne,Before it the ransom'd stand;No longer are tears, no sorrow is knownNor death in that goodly land.My Saviour has gone before,Preparing the way for me;Soon we'll meet to part no moreThru' time or eternity.CHORUSSince Jesus has set me free,I'm happy as heart can be;No longer I bear the burden of care,His yoke is so sweet to me,My soul was as black as night,But darkness has taken flight;Now I shout the victory,For Jesus has set me free.The gates of that holy placeStand open by night and day;Look to the Lord who giveth more grace,Whose love has prepared the way.A home in those mansions fairHis hands hath reserved for all.For the wedding feast prepare,Obeying the gracious call.CHORUSSince Jesus has set me free,I'm happy as heart can be;No longer I bear the burden of care,His yoke is so sweet to me,My soul was as black as night,But darkness has taken flight;Now I shout the victory,For Jesus has set me free.Oh Jesus is coming soon,Our trials will then be o'er.What if our Lord this moment should comeFor those who are free from sin?Then would it bring you joy,Or sorrow and deep despair?When our Lord in glory comes,We'll meet Him up in the air.CHORUSSince Jesus has set me free,I'm happy as heart can be;No longer I bear the burden of care,His yoke is so sweet to me,My soul was as black as night,But darkness has taken flight;Now I shout the victory,For Jesus has set me free.
