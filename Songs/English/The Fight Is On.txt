The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out,The cry To arms is heard afar and near;The Lord of hosts is marching on to victory,The triumph of the right will soon appear.CHORUSThe fight is on, O Christian soldiers,And face to face in stern array,With armour gleaming, and colours streaming,The right and wrong engage today;The fight is on, but be not weary,Be strong and in his might hold fast;If God be for us, His banner o'er us,We'll sing the victor's song at last.The fight is on, arouse ye soldiers brace and true,Jehovah leads, and vict'ry will assure,Go buckle on the armour God has given you,And in His strength unto the end endure.CHORUSThe fight is on, O Christian soldiers,And face to face in stern array,With armour gleaming, and colours streaming,The right and wrong engage today;The fight is on, but be not weary,Be strong and in his might hold fast;If God be for us, His banner o'er us,We'll sing the victor's song at last.The Lord is leading on to certain victory,The Bow of Promise spans the eastern sky;HIs glorious name in every land shall honored be,The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.CHORUSThe fight is on, O Christian soldiers,And face to face in stern array,With armour gleaming, and colours streaming,The right and wrong engage today;The fight is on, but be not weary,Be strong and in his might hold fast;If God be for us, His banner o'er us,We'll sing the victor's song at last.
