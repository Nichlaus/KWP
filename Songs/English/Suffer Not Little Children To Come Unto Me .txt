 When mothers of Salem Their children brought to Jesus, The stern disciples drove them back, And bade them depart: But Jesus saw them ere they fled, And sweetly smiled and kindly said, Suffer not little children to come unto Me For I will receive them, And fold them in My bosom; I'll be a Shepherd to those lambs, Oh, drive them not away! For if their hearts to Me they give, They shall with Me in glory live: Suffer not little children to come unto Me. How kind was our Saviour To bid those children welcome! But there are many thousands who have never heard His Name; The Bible they have never read; They know not that the Saviour said, Suffer not little children to come unto Me. Oh,soon may the heathen Of every tribe and nation Fulfil Thy blessed word, and cast Their idols all away; Oh, shine upon them from above, And show Thyself a God of love; Teach the little children to come unto Thee.
