 I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold I'd rather be His than have riches untold I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands I'd rather be led by His nails pierced hands. CHORUS Than to be a king of a vast domain Or be held by sins great sway I'd rather have Jesus than anything This world affords today. I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause I'd rather have Jesus than world wide fame I'd rather be true to His holy name. CHORUS Than to be a king of a vast domain Or be held by sins great sway I'd rather have Jesus than anything This world affords today. He's fairer than the Lilies of rarest bloom He's sweeter than the honey out of the comb He's all that my hungering spirit needs I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead.. CHORUS Than to be a king of a vast domain Or be held by sins great sway I'd rather have Jesus than anything This world affords today.
