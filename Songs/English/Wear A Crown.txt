Am I a soldier of the cross,A follower of the lamb,And shall I fear to own His cause,Or blush to speak His name?CHORUSAnd when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown!Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, we shall wear a crown!And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Wear a crown, wear a crown,Wear a bright and shining crown,And when the battle is over we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Must I be carried to the skiesOn flow'ry beds of ease,While others fought to win the prize,And sailed through bloody seas?CHORUSAnd when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown!Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, we shall wear a crown!And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Wear a crown, wear a crown,Wear a bright and shining crown,And when the battle is over we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Are there no floers for me to face?Must I not stem the flood?Is this vile world a friend to graceTo help me on to God?CHORUSAnd when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown!Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, we shall wear a crown!And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Wear a crown, wear a crown,Wear a bright and shining crown,And when the battle is over we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Sure I must fight if I would reign,Increase my courage, Lord;I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,Supported by thy word.CHORUSAnd when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown!Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes, we shall wear a crown!And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.Wear a crown, wear a crown,Wear a bright and shining crown,And when the battle is over we shall wear a crownIn the new Jerusalem.
