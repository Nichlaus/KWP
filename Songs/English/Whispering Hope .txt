 Soft as the voice of an angel, Breathing a lesson unheard Hope with a gentle persuasion Whispers comforting word Wait till the darkness is over Wait till the tempest is done Hope for the sunshine tomorrow After the shower is gone. CHORUS Whispering hope how welcome Thy voice Oh how welcome Thy voice Making my heart In it's sorrow rejoice. If in the dusk of the twilight Dim be the region afar, Will not the deepening darkness brighten The glimmering star? Then when the night is upon us; Why should the heart sink away? When the dark midnight is over Watch for the breaking of the day. CHORUS Whispering hope how welcome Thy voice Oh how welcome Thy voice Making my heart In it's sorrow rejoice. Hope as an anchor so steadfast Rends the dark veil for the soul Whither the Master has entered, Robbing the grave of its goal. Come then, O come glad fruition, Come to my sad weary heart,come, Never O never depart. CHORUS Whispering hope how welcome Thy voice Oh how welcome Thy voice Making my heart In it's sorrow rejoice.
