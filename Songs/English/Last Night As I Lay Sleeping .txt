 Last night as I lay sleeping A dream came to me, I dreamt about the end of time and about eternity; I saw a million sinners fall on their faces to pray, The Saviour sadly shook His head, And this I heard Him say: Sorry, I never knew you, Depart from me for ever more; Sorry, I never knew you, Go and serve the one that you served before. I thought the times had fully come When I must stand the trial, I told the Lord that I had been a Christian all the while; Then through the Book He carefully looked And sadly shook His head: He placed me over on His left And this is what He said: Sorry, I never knew you, Depart from me for ever more; Sorry, I never knew you, Go and serve the one that you served before. There was my wife and children I heard each one's voice, They must have been so happy - It seemed they did rejoice With robes of white all round them And crowns upon their heads; My little girl looked up to me And this is what she said: Daddy, we can't go with you, We must dwell in the joys of our Lord; Sorry,but we still love you But you^ll never be our daddy any more. When from sleep I awakened with tears in my eyes, I looked around about me, And to my great surprise, I saw my wife and babies, And knew I had a dream; And down beside my bed I fell And poured my sins' history. Father, who art in heaven, In mercy look on me today, Forgive me and let me serve You, Till Thy Son has come and carries me away.
