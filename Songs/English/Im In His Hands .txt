 Why should I fear though darkened Clouds may gather round me The God I serve is one who cares and understands Although the storms of life may threaten to confound me All this Im confident Im in His hands CHORUS Im in his hands (x2) Whatever the future holds Im in his hands The days I cannot see, Have all been planned for me His way is best you see Im in His hands In days gone by my Lord has always proved sufficient When I have yielded to the law His love demands Why should I doubt that He will evermore be faithful To make His will my own While Im in His hands CHORUS Im in his hands (x2) Whatever the future holds Im in his hands The days I cannot see, Have all been planned for me His way is best you see Im in His hands
