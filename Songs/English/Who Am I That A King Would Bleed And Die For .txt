 When I think of how He came so far from glory, Came to dwell amongst the lowly such as I, To suffer shame and such disgrace, On Mt. Calvary take my place, Then I ask myself the question, Who am I? CHORUS Who am I that a King would bleed and die for? Who am I that He would pray not my will thine Lord? The answer I may never know, Why He ever loved me so, But to an old rugged cross to go, For who am I? When I'm reminded of His word, I'll leave thee never, Just be true, I'll give to you a life Forever, I wonder what I could have done, To deserve God's only Son To fight my battles until they^re won, Who am I? CHORUS Who am I that a King would bleed and die for? Who am I that He would pray not my will thine Lord? The answer I may never know, Why He ever loved me so, But to an old rugged cross to go, For who am I?
