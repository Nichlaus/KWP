 I hope to live till Jesus comes back to this earth again, And catches up His chosen bride,a thousand years to reign, But should I die before that time I know this empty clay, Will be caught up to meet the Lord; I'll be there anyway. CHORUS Oh praise the Lord for this great hope That cheers me day by day, For if I'm not caught up alive, I'll be there anyway. So farewell friends if we should part on earth to meet no more, I'll meet you in the skies some day when earthy clouds are rolled But should I die before that time and you are alive that day, Just look for me for I intend,to be there anyway. CHORUS Oh praise the Lord for this great hope That cheers me day by day, For if I'm not caught up alive, I'll be there anyway.
