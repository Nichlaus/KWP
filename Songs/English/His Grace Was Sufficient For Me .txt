 His grace was sufficient for me! When in trembling and fear; To His side I drew near, And He cleansed me from sin, Made my heart pure within, His grace was sufficient for me. CHORUS For me ... for me... His grace Is sufficient for me... For me... for me His grace Is sufficient for me. His grace was sufficient for me! And whatever my lot, I can hear His Fear not! I am safe in His care, Who can guard from each snare His grace is sufficient for me. CHORUS For me ... for me... His grace Is sufficient for me... For me... for me His grace Is sufficient for me. His grace is sufficient for me! All my needs He^ll provide, And my steps homeward guide; And in death I shall sing, As I rest neath His wing, His grace is sufficient for me. CHORUS For me ... for me... His grace Is sufficient for me... For me... for me His grace Is sufficient for me. His grace is sufficient for me! When in mansions of bliss, Still my theme shall be this; And for aye I shall sing To the praise of my King Whose grace is sufficient for me. CHORUS For me ... for me... His grace Is sufficient for me... For me... for me His grace Is sufficient for me.
