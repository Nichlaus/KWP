 I don't know all the answers, But I know the Answer Man, I can't solve all my problems, But I know the one who can. I have a direct wire right to the Lord above, He has promised to answer every prayer, Oh, He's the Man with the answers, I'm glad I know the Answer Man. I don't fret stray or worry, For my life is in His hands Troubles run in a hurry They all flee at His command, Put your trust in Him He'll lead you constantly. For He loves you the same as He loves me And then you tell everybody, I'm glad I know the Answer Man. Yesterday and tomorrow Only meet with us today And today we can't borrow What the two can never pay The Answer Man alone Knows all our future plans I am so happy my life is in His hands So today, I've no sorrows, Because I know the Answer Man.
