 I have a friend, a precious friend, Oh how He loves me He says His love will never end Oh how He loves me. CHORUS Oh, how He loves me x 2 I know not why I only cry Oh, how He loves me. Why He should come I cannot tell Oh, how He loves me, In my poor broken heart to dwell Oh, how He loves me. CHORUS Oh, how He loves me x 2 I know not why I only cry Oh, how He loves me. He died to save my soul from death, Oh, how He loves me, I will praise Him while He gives me breath Oh, how He loves me. CHORUS Oh, how He loves me x 2 I know not why I only cry Oh, how He loves me. He walks with me along life's road, Oh, how He loves me He carries every heavy load, Oh, how He loves me. CHORUS Oh, how He loves me x 2 I know not why I only cry Oh, how He loves me. He has a home prepared for me, Oh, how He loves me, With Him I'll spend eternity Oh, how He loves me. CHORUS Oh, how He loves me x 2 I know not why I only cry Oh, how He loves me.
