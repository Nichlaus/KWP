 Jesus walked along the shore one day Heavy burdens,love for others, On Him lay; He was looking for a friend, He was searching for twelve men; Who would gladly follow all the way. Twelve men, chosen men; Jesus was looking for twelve men. First He called for Andrew, by the shore; Told his brother, Simon Peter, He had a chore; And of one He was so fond, You recall, his name was John; Still He called for Judas, And eight more - Simon James the Elder, Jude,Mathew. Thomas, Philip, James the less,Bartholomew. These twelve men the world did hate, Striving to eliminate; This is how they finally met their fate Twelve men, chosen men; Eleven of them true, but one a devil Judas sold the Son of God for silver. Andrew died upon a cross we hear; Thomas killed in India, with a spear; James the less was sawn in two, Arrows through the body of Jude, Philip died by hanging without fear. Late in life, by knife, Bartholomew, Martyred Simon, James the elder; Writer Mathew.  Simon Peter they say was found,  Crucified there upside down;  Only John did live his full life through.  Twelve men, chosen men;  Eleven of them true,but one a devil  Judas hung himself but lost his silver.
