 I have been on the mountain and in the valley so low When it seemed I'd never had a place to go, Then I found Jesus,now He is mine; And there's no mountain I can't climb. CHORUS There is no mountain that we can't climb When I say we I mean Jesus and me If you got Jesus and He is thine, There is no mountain that you can't climb. I was in despair and troubles beset me, Tears filled my eyes and I could not see; Till I trusted Jesus and His love divine, Now there's no mountain that I can't climb. CHORUS There is no mountain that we' can't climb When I say we I mean Jesus and me If you got Jesus and He is thine, There is no mountain that you can't climb.
