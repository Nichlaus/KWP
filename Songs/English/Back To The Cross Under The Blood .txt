 Sometimes the vision gets clouded in view When we begin talking our lifes overview But theres a place we can go To renew our first love Back to the cross and under the blood CHORUS Back to the cross where victory is won And under the blood where healing is done Where we can always find rest His mercies and love When we go back to the cross and under the blood With the world on the outside and Jesus within Theres always temptations to give up or give in And when you feel the enemy come like a flood Go back to the cross and under the blood CHORUS Back to the cross where victory is won And under the blood where healing is done Where we can always find rest His mercies and love When we go back to the cross and under the blood Now if you dont know Him Provision is made For the price of redemption is already paid And theres room for one more Beneath that soul cleansing flood it's back to the cross and under the blood CHORUS Back to the cross where victory is won And under the blood where healing is done Where we can always find rest His mercies and love When we go back to the cross and under the blood
