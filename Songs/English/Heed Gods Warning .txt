 The rain drops fell on the seventh day After God had closed the door The people then in fear did pray that Noah please open the door? The mocking stopped and the laughter ceased When judgement began to fall Though the people cried have mercy Lord But God would not hear their call. CHORUS So don't wait, don't hesitate Heed the warning of God's call So don't wait, don't hesitate For destruction is at hand God shall come to Judge the world As He did then. The fire fell in Abraham's day When Sodom was destroyed Two angels went to Lot that day And said warn your family All went out but one look back And judgement fell on her So don't look back just look ahead To God and you won't stray. CHORUS So don't wait, don't hesitate Heed the warning of God's call So don't wait, don't hesitate For destruction is at hand God shall come to Judge the world As He did then.
