In the dark of the midnight have I oft hid my faceWhile the storm howls above me, and there's no hiding place'Mid the crash of the thunder, Precious Lord, hear my cryKeep me safe till the storm passes byTill the storm passes over, till the thunder sounds no moreTill the clouds roll forever from the skyHold me fast, let me stand in the hollow of Thy handKeep me safe till the storm passes byMany times Satan whispered, "There is no need to tryFor there's no end of sorrow, there's no hope by and by"But I know Thou art with me, and tomorrow I'll riseWhere the storms never darken the skiesTill the storm passes over, till the thunder sounds no moreTill the clouds roll forever from the skyHold me fast, let me stand in the hollow of Thy handKeep me safe till the storm passes byWhen the long night has ended and the storms come no moreLet me stand in Thy presence on the bright peaceful shoreIn that land where the tempest, never comes, Lord, may IDwell with Thee when the storm passes byTill the storm passes over, till the thunder sounds no moreTill the clouds roll forever from the skyHold me fast, let me stand in the hollow of Thy handKeep me safe till the storm passes by
