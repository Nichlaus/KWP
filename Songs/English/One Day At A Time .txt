 I'm only human, I'm just a woman Help me believe in what I could be And all that I am, Show me the stairway, I have to climb Lord for my sake,teach me to take One day at a time. CHORUS One day at a time sweet Jesus, That's all am asking from you, Just give me the strength to do every day What I have to do, Yesterday Is gone sweet Jesus, And tomorrow may never be mine Lord help me today, show me the way, One day at a time. Do you remember,when you walked among men, Well Jesus you know,as you're looking below It's worse now than then Pushing and shouting,Lord in my mind, So for my sake,Lord teach me to take, One day at a time. CHORUS One day at a time sweet Jesus, That's all am asking from you, Just give me the strength to do every day What I have to do, Yesterday Is gone sweet Jesus, And tomorrow may never be mine Lord help me today, show me the way, One day at a time.
