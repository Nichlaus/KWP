 Jerusalem the golden, With milk and honey blest, Beneath thy contemplation Sink heart and voice oppressed: I know not, oh, I know not, What radiancy of glory, What bliss beyond compare. They stand, those hills of Zion, All jubilant with song; And bright with many an angel, And all the martyr - throng: The Prince is ever in them, The daylight is serene, The pastures of the blessed Are decked in glorious sheen. There is the throne of David, And there, from care released, The shout of them that triumph, The song of them that feast; And they who with their Leader Have conquered in the fight, For ever and for ever Are clothed in robes of white. Oh, sweet and blessed country, The home of God's elect! Oh, sweet and blessed country That eager hearts expect! Jesus,in mercy bring us To that dear land of rest, Who art, with God the Father, And Spirit, ever blest.
