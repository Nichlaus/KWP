 Be of good courage, God spake unto Joshua, When over the river God pointed the way; Jordan uncrossable! Things seemed impossible, Waters divide as they march and obey. CHORUS Got any rivers you think are uncrossable? Got any mountains you can't tunnel through? God specializes in things thought impossible, And He will do what no other power can do. Battles to win! They would meet with their obstacles, Jericho's walls, too, must fall to the ground. God never failed; He stood back of His promises, Walls had to crumble as they marched around. CHORUS Got any rivers you think are uncrossable? Got any mountains you can't tunnel through? God specializes in things thought impossible, And He will do what no other power can do. God is the same and His Word is dependable, He'll make a way through the waters for you; Life's situations by Him are amendable. Mountains and hills He will part for you too. CHORUS Got any rivers you think are uncrossable? Got any mountains you can't tunnel through? God specializes in things thought impossible, And He will do what no other power can do.
