 My burdens keep me humble And teach me to pray If I've murmured or grumbled Forgive the words I say Give me grace to follow My road day by day Don't take my burdens Or my cross away. CHORUS For I would grow careless And I would not fear My eyes would be dry And I'd never shed a tear Lest I forget that I need Thee each day Don't take my burdens Or my cross away. With the cross on my shoulders My heart cannot stray For the cross leads me onward To my home far away And I will not question the way He must lead Don't take my burdens Or my cross away. CHORUS For I would grow careless And I would not fear My eyes would be dry And I'd never shed a tear Lest I forget that I need Thee each day Don't take my burdens Or my cross away.
