 In the temple of the Lord, In the year King Uzziah died, The prophet in great sorrow, Sought God's peace to find As he raised his voice in anguish All at once Isaiah cried, It's the Lord I see lifted up and seated high. CHORUS I saw the Lord, I saw the Lord, He was high and lifted up And His train filled the temple The angels cried, holy, Yes, the angels cried holy, All the angels cried holy Is the Lord. And today my friend and brother, And my sister who've seen the light, You may have a friend Uzziah From whom the Lord still hides It may be your wealth or fortune Or ambitions but till they^ve died You can never like Isaiah Lift your head and cry. CHORUS I saw the Lord, I saw the Lord, He was high and lifted up And His train filled the temple The angels cried, holy, Yes, the angels cried holy, All the angels cried holy Is the Lord.
