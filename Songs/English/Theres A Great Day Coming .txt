 There's a great day coming, a great day coming, There's a great day coming by and by, When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left, Are you ready for that day to come? CHORUS Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgement day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgement day? There's a bright day coming, a bright day coming, There's a bright daycoming by and by, But its brightness shall only come to them that love the Lord, Are you ready for that day to come? CHORUS Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgement day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgement day? There's a sad day coming, a sad day coming, There's a sad day coming by and by, When the sinner shall hear his doom, Depart, I know ye not, Are you ready for that day to come? CHORUS Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready for the judgement day? Are you ready? Are you ready? For the judgement day?
