 I wondered again of my home in heaven, Where we shall have peace and be happy and free, Where Jesus shall rule and the saints be with Him, Where we shall be young and we'll never grow old. CHORUS Everybody up there, Will give praise to the Master Nobody up there that will disagree We all will be one,big family in heaven And we will all have a name of the Father above. I want to thank God for the seventh angel The vessel Go chose to bring forth His word Now the prophet has gone and the days here are numbered When Jesus will come to take home His bride. CHORUS Everybody up there, Will give praise to the Master Nobody up there that will disagree We all will be one,big family in heaven And we will all have a name of the Father above.
