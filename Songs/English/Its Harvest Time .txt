 CHORUS It's harvest time and I can hear the combine coming, To gather in the grain and take it home; The tares will all be burned because God's Word says so I'm so glad aren't you glad too it's harvest time. Now God sent us a prophet In this end-time age, To tell us of the coming of the Lord He said we must go back to our fathers faith, Or we'll perish with the guilty if we fail CHORUS It's harvest time and I can hear the combine coming, To gather in the grain and take it home; The tares will all be burned because God^s Word says so I'm so glad aren't you glad too it's harvest time. Now it seems there's a lot of action all around us, And the people will say why do you stand so still, If they'd only know the Message of the hour, They'd know we're wheat that's ripening in the Master's field. CHORUS It's harvest time and I can hear the combine coming, To gather in the grain and take it home; The tares will all be burned because God's Word says so I'm so glad aren't you glad too it's harvest time.
