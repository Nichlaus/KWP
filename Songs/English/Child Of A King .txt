 Once I was clothed in the rags of my sin, Wretched and poor,lost and lonely within, But with wondrous compassion the King of all kings, In pity and love took me under His wings. CHORUS Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King, His Royal Blood now flows In my veins, And I who was wretched and poor now can sing, Praise God, praise God, I'm a child of the King. Now I'm a child with a Heavenly home, My Heavenly Father hath made me His Own, And I'm cleansed by His Blood and I'm clothed in His love, And someday I'll sing with the angels above. CHORUS Oh yes, oh yes, I'm a child of the King, His Royal Blood now flows In my veins, And I who was wretched and poor now can sing, Praise God, praise God, I'm a child of the King.
