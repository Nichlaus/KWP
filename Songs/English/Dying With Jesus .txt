 Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine; Living with Jesus a new life divine; Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine Moment by moment, O Lord I am Thine CHORUS Moment by moment Im kept in His love Moment by moment I've life from above Looking to Jesus still glory doth shine; Moment by moment O Lord I am Thine Never a battle with wrong for the right Never a contest that He doth not fight Lifting above us His banner so white Moment by moment Im kept in His sight CHORUS Moment by moment Im kept in His love Moment by moment I've life from above Looking to Jesus still glory doth shine; Moment by moment O Lord I am Thine Never a trial that He is not there, Never a burden that He doth not bear Never a sorrow that He doth not share Moment by moment Im under His care CHORUS Moment by moment Im kept in His love Moment by moment I've life from above Looking to Jesus still glory doth shine; Moment by moment O Lord I am Thine Never a heart- ache, and never a groan Never a tear drop, and never a moan; Never a danger but there on the throne Moment by moment He thinks of His own CHORUS Moment by moment Im kept in His love Moment by moment I've life from above Looking to Jesus still glory doth shine; Moment by moment O Lord I am Thine Never a weakness that He doth not feel Never a sickness that He cannot heal; Moment by moment in woe or in weal Jesus my saviour, abides with me still CHORUS Moment by moment Im kept in His love Moment by moment I've life from above Looking to Jesus still glory doth shine; Moment by moment O Lord I am Thine
