 Straying I strayed from the living way From the way of the truth Thinking Id find rest at last Until Thy grace found my soul CHORUS Now when I reach on the other shore Ill praise Thee for Thy amazing grace Seeking I sought yet I could not find Until Thy grace found my soul Trying I tried to please the Lord But according to my mine I thought you just needed someone good Until Thy grace rescued me CHORUS Now when I reach on the other shore Ill praise Thee for Thy amazing grace Seeking I sought yet I could not find Until Thy grace found my soul Praying I prayed fro days on end Thinking only then can you save Not knowing that by Thy amazing grace You bought me before I met you CHORUS Now when I reach on the other shore Ill praise Thee for Thy amazing grace Seeking I sought yet I could not find Until Thy grace found my soul
