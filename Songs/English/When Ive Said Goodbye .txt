 When I've left and said goodbye Oh don't you worry, For I'm just going home Yes my Saviours outstretched arms Are waiting for me Oh yes Don't you worry I'm just going home. CHORUS I'll be up there in that mansion I shall walk on streets of pure gold And when I've left and said goodbye For that city in the sky Oh don't you worry I'm just going home. It is not for just a day but forever My Saviour's presence I shall behold Yes and when at last there's peace eternal Oh yes Don't you worry I'm just going home. And when I've left and said goodbye For that city in the sky O don't you worry, I'm just going home. CHORUS I'll be up there in that mansion I shall walk on streets of pure gold And when I've left and said goodbye For that city in the sky Oh don't you worry I'm just going home.
