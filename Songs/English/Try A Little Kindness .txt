 If you see your brother standing by the road With a heavy load,from the seeds he's sowed And if you see your sister fallen by the road Just stop and say you^re going the wrong way. CHORUS You've,got to try a little kindness Yes,Show a little kindness Shine your light for everyone to see And If you try a little kindness Than you'll overlook the blindness Of the narrow-minded people In their narrow-minded streets. Don't walk around the down and out Lend a helping hand instead of doubts And the little kindness that you show every day Will help someone along the way. CHORUS You've,got to try a little kindness Yes,Show a little kindness Shine your light for everyone to see And If you try a little kindness Than you'll overlook the blindness Of the narrow-minded people In their narrow-minded streets.
