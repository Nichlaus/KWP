 All the troubles and heartaches we've known here below As we travel this wearisome land, We're pilgrims and strangers looking for a home, Till the day when we'll lay our burdens down. CHORUS One day we shall rest at Jesus feet When the troubles of this life will be o^er Where death cannot enter there'll be no more night In that city where the Lamb Is the light. Oh the river of life, in that city of gold Is prepared for His loving bride Just think of the mansion no man could describe And it's glory that our eyes shall behold. CHORUS One day we shall rest at Jesus feet When the troubles of this life will be o^er Where death cannot enter there'll be no more night In that city where the Lamb Is the light.
