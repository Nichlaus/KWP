 Man of sorrows, what a Name, For the Son of God who came, Ruined sinners to reclaim, Hallelujah, what a Saviour. Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood, Sealed my pardon with His Blood, Hallelujah, what a Saviour. Guilty, vile, and helpless we, Spotless Lamb of God was He, Full of atonement can't it be? Hallelujah, what a Saviour. Lifted up was He to die, It is finished, was His cry; Now in Heaven exalted high; Hallelujah, what a Saviour. When He comes our Glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring Then a new this song we'll sing, Hallelujah, what a Saviour.
