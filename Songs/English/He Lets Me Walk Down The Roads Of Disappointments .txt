 Well He lets me walk down roads Of disappointment He watches And He knows what's best for me, My greatest strength comes through my darkest trials And my greatest joy is knowing that He can trust in me. CHORUS That's just His way of telling me He loves me, It's a love beyond all human understanding,  I'll not question trials  That bring me to my knees  That's just His way of telling me,  He loves me.  If I'm Successful walking through these valleys,  He'll give me strength to climb the highest hill  And the more I'm tried the better  He can mould me,  And change my life completely,  That it will fit His perfect will.  CHORUS  That's just His way of telling me  He loves me,  It's a love beyond all human understanding,  I'll not question trials  That bring me to my knees  That's just His way of telling me,  He loves me.
