I care not today what the morrow may bring,If shadow or sunshine or rain,The Lord I know ruleth o'er everything,And all of my worry is vain.CHORUSLiving by faith, in Jesus above,Trusting, confining in His great love;From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.Though tempest may blow and the stormclouds arise,OBsecuring the brightness of life,I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies,The Master looks on at the strife.CHORUSLiving by faith, in Jesus above,Trusting, confining in His great love;From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.I know that He safely will carry me through,No matter what evils betide!Why should I then care, though the tempest may blow,If Jesus walks close to my side.CHORUSLiving by faith, in Jesus above,Trusting, confining in His great love;From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.Our Lord will return to this earth some sweet day,Our troubles will then all be o'er,The Master so gently will'lead us away,Beyond that blest heavenly shore.CHORUSLiving by faith, in Jesus above,Trusting, confining in His great love;From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.
