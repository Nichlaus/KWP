 Often you've wondered why Tears come into your eyes, And burdens seem to be much more Than you can stand, But God is standing near, He sees your falling tears Tears are a language that God understands. CHORUS God sees the tears of a broken heart and soul, He sees your tears and hears them when they fall, God weeps along with man and takes him by the hand, Tears are a language that God understands. When grief has left you low, It causes tears to flow And things have not turned out The way you have planned, But God won't forget you, His promises are true, Tears are a language that God understands. CHORUS God sees the tears of a broken heart and soul, He sees your tears and hears them when they fall, God weeps along with man and takes him by the hand, Tears are a language that God understands.
