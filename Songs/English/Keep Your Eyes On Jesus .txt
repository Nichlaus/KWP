 Struggling through this world Of sin and sorrow We're trusting in Jesus every day Waiting for a happy bright tomorrow When Jesus comes to take His bride away. CHORUS Keep your eyes on Jesus When the tides and waves of troubles round you roll He will calm the toils of life That toss your soul. When the life you live is not worthy living, I know one who cares and understands, He will cleanse your heart and make you happy And lead you to that home not made with hands. CHORUS Keep your eyes on Jesus When the tides and waves of troubles round you roll He will calm the toils of life That toss your soul.
