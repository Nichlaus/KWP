 I don't believe that God Would ever do a job half done And I don't believe He would waste His time Making nobodies just for fun. CHORUS I'm a somebody who's built by God And my ship just can't be sunk I'm a somebody And I know its true Because God don't make no junk I'm a somebody I'm a somebody. There's never been Another person made just like me And there's never been Another you You're a somebody Don^t you see. CHORUS I'm a somebody who's built by God And my ship just can't be sunk I'm a somebody And I know its true Because God don't make no junk I'm a somebody I'm a somebody.
