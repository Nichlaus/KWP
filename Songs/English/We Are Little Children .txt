 We are little children, Very young indeed, But the Saviour's promise Each of us may plead. CHORUS If we seek Him early, If we come today, We can be Ills little friends, He has said we may. Little friends of Jesus - What a happy thought What a precious promise In the Bible taught! CHORUS If we seek Him early, If we come today, We can be Ills little friends, He has said we may. Little friends of Jesus, Walking by His side, With His arm around us, Every step to guide. CHORUS If we seek Him early, If we come today, We can be Ills little friends, He has said we may. We must love Him dearly, With a constant love, Then we'll go and see Him In our home above. CHORUS If we seek Him early, If we come today, We can be Ills little friends, He has said we may.
