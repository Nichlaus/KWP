 CHORUS Never the same again(now know) I won't be the same again From the moment I met Jesus My new life began And I Won't be the same(no never) The same again. I remember how He waited, How He got me From my own way I used to wander on my way But nothing worked out right Till the day He made me surrender Jesus took my life And I won't be the same(no never) The same again. CHORUS Never the same again(now know) I won't be the same again From the moment I met Jesus My new life began And I Won't be the same(no never) The same again. He may take me through the valley Even through I am His child And the road He shows may be rough and rugged for a while But He takes my heart and speaks the Word That lightens up my way And I won't be the same(no never) The same again. CHORUS Never the same again(now know) I won't be the same again From the moment I met Jesus My new life began And I Won't be the same(no never) The same again.
