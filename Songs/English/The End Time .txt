 I look and see earth's sorrowing picture, The hoarding mobs for selfish gain; Their toil of hand for ease and comfort, Can they not see, their doom is sealed, it's all in vain. CHORUS The end is here, it's now at hand, The Bride is gathering; the world is failing; Israel's awak'ning; nations are breaking^ Our prophet taught us, we believe the end is here. Sirs, this is the time! Our prophet spoke of, The Angel came with a Shout, The mountain shook as His Voice cried out, Time is no more. Loud and clear the Shout went forth. CHORUS The end is here, it's now at hand, The Bride is gathering; the world is failing; Israel's awak'ning; nations are breaking^ Our prophet taught us, we believe the end is here. Have you considered the end-time Message? Have you considered Malachi 4? Revelation 10:7 and St. Luke 17 Proclaims this Message now, and then forevermore. CHORUS The end is here, it's now at hand, The Bride is gathering; the world is failing; Israel's awak'ning; nations are breaking^ Our prophet taught us, we believe the end is here.
