 One day I was wondering what life's all about, Life was full of heartaches,restlessness, and doubt; Then a gentle stranger whispered words of life, Pointed me to Heaven,wrote my name above. CHORUS I know where I'm going and whom I'm going to see; I have a friend named Jesus Waiting there for me, He has given me something that only He could give - He gave His life in payment so that I could live. There are many mansions He has prepared there, That could not be purchased by a millionaire; Streets of gold there glitter,gates of pearly white, In that day eternal where there'II be no night. CHORUS I know where I'm going and whom I'm going to see; I have a friend named Jesus Waiting there for me, He has given me something that only He could give - He gave His life in payment so that I could live. Friends if you are searching for a better way, I am recommending Jesus,trust in Him today; He will give life meaning like no other can: Come and travel with me to that promised land. CHORUS I know where I'm going and whom I'm going to see; I have a friend named Jesus Waiting there for me, He has given me something that only He could give - He gave His life in payment so that I could live.
