 Pick up the broken pieces And bring them to the Lord Pick up the broken pieces Trust in His Holy Word He will put them back together; And make your life complete Just place the broken pieces At the Saviour's feet. Have you failed in life's battle To accomplish your plans, Is your heart heavy laden Do you fear the Lord's command? Do you feel that no ones loves you And there's no use to try Take up your case to Jesus Your soul He'll satisfy. Do you feel that there is no hope Broken hearts cannot mend, Christ can take the broken pieces And make you whole again Storms of doubt blow from all directions But don't you be afraid God can make all correction He made your body out of clay.
