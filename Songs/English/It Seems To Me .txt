 It seems to me this is the day, When men's hearts in sins are swayed, And their eyes are turning blind Loving sin with all their might. CHORUS But as for me I will serve the Lord With all my heart and all my mind Keep looking up to God's own Word For my comfort there I find. Yes my comfort there I find. How glad I am that I've been saved From sin and shame that kept me a slave Now I can soar above the world For my strength comes from above. CHORUS But as for me I will serve the Lord With all my heart and all my mind Keep looking up to God's own Word For my comfort there I find. Yes my comfort there I find.
