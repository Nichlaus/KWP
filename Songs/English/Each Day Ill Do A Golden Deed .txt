 Each day I'll do a golden deed, By helping those who are in need; My life on earth is but a span, And so I will do the best I can. CHORUS Life's evening sun,Is sinking low, A few more days and I must go, To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun. While going down life's weary road, I'll try to lift some traveller^s load, I'll try to turn the night to day; Make flowers bloom along the way. CHORUS Life's evening sun,Is sinking low, A few more days and I must go, To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun. I'll help someone in times of need And journey on with a rapid speed; I'll help the weak, the poor, the sick, Each day I'll lend a helping hand. CHORUS Life's evening sun,Is sinking low, A few more days and I must go, To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun.
