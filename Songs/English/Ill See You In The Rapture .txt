 CHORUS I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you at that meeting in the air There with our Blessed Saviour, We'll live and reign forever, I'll see you In the Rapture some sweet day. If we never meet again, On this earth my precious friend, If to God you have been true, And you've lived above all sin; Then for us there'll be a meeting; And a hallelujah greeting; I'll see you in the Rapture some sweet day. CHORUS I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you at that meeting in the air There with our Blessed Saviour, We'll live and reign forever, I'll see you In the Rapture some sweet day. To my loved ones let me say, That there'll surely come a day, When our Lord shall come again, To take His Bride away, So get ready now to meet Him, And with hallelujahs greet Him, I'll see you in the Rapture some sweet day. CHORUS I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you In the Rapture, I'll see you at that meeting in the air There with our Blessed Saviour, We'll live and reign forever, I'll see you In the Rapture some sweet day.
