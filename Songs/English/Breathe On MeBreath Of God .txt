 Breathe on me, Breath of God, Fill me with life a new, That I may love what Thou dost love, And do what Thou wouldst do. Breathe on me, Breath of God, Until my heart is pure, Until with Thee my will Thy will, To do and to endure. Breathe on me, Breath of God Till I am wholly Thine, Till all this earthly part of me, Glows with Thy Fire Divine. Breathe on me, Breath of God, So shall I never die, But live with Thee the perfect Life Of Thine Eternity.
