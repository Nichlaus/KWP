 One day I heard a voice Saying make the Lord your choice I'll take away your every sin And set you free, So I came to Him that day And He took my sins away Now I don't want nothing here to hinder me. CHORUS I don't want nothing here to hinder me For some day His blessed face I want to see, It makes no difference what the cost Or how heavy my cross I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Many times I'm tossed about, Many times I do without And many times my heart is burdened down with care But I know if I stay true Then some day He'll see me through If I don't let nothing here hinder me. CHORUS I don't want nothing here to hinder me For some day His blessed face I want to see, It makes no difference what the cost Or how heavy my cross I don't want nothing here to hinder me.
