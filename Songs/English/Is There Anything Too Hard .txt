 One day I was thinking of Jesus my Lord, And salvation so full and so free, The cares of this life were heavy to bear, Then He whispered so sweetly to me. CHORUS Is there anything too hard to bear, Sure there's something that Ican always do, All power in heaven is given to me, Believe me and I will see you through. Is your heart burdened with problems and cares Does your life seem wasted away? Come to Jesus the Saviour, Repent of all your sins, Just believe and to you He will say. CHORUS Is there anything too hard to bear, Sure there's something that Ican always do, All power in heaven is given to me, Believe me and I will see you through.
