 As I travel through this pilgrim land There is a friend who walks with me: Leads me safely through the sinking sand It is the Christ of Calvary, This would be my prayer dear Lord each day To help me do the best I can As I need Thy light to guide me Day and night Precious Jesus hold my hand. CHORUS Jesus hold my hand, I need Thee every hour Through this pilgrim land, Oh! help me by Thy power Hear my feeble plea oh dear Lord Look down on me When I kneel In prayer I hope to meet you there; Blessed Jesus hold my hand. Let me travel in Thy light divine That I may see Thy blessed way Keep me that I may be wholly Thine And sing redemption song some day I will be a soldier brave and true; And ever firmly take a stand: As I onward go and daily meet the foe Blessed Jesus hold my hand. CHORUS Jesus hold my hand, I need Thee every hour Through this pilgrim land, Oh! help me by Thy power Hear my feeble plea oh dear Lord Look down on me When I kneel In prayer I hope to meet you there; Blessed Jesus hold my hand. When I wander thro^ the valley of death Towards the setting of the sun, Lead me safely to the land of rest To wear a crown of life I've won; I here put my faith on Thee dear Lord That I may reach that golden strand, There's no other friend on whom I can depend Blessed Jesus hold my hand. CHORUS Jesus hold my hand, I need Thee every hour Through this pilgrim land, Oh! help me by Thy power Hear my feeble plea oh dear Lord Look down on me When I kneel In prayer I hope to meet you there; Blessed Jesus hold my hand.
