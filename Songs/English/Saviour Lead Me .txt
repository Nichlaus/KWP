 Saviour lead me, lest I stray. Gently lead me all the way;. I am safe when By Thy side... I would in Thy love abide. CHORUS Lead me, lead me Saviour, lead me lest I stray Gently down the stream of time Lead me, Saviour, all the way. Thou, the refuge of my soul,... When life's stormy billows roll,... I am safe whenThou art nigh;... All my hopes on Thee rely. CHORUS Lead me, lead me Saviour, lead me lest I stray Gently down the stream of time Lead me, Saviour, all the way. Saviour, lead me then at last,... When the storm of life is past,... To the land of endless day,... Where all tears are wiped away. CHORUS Lead me, lead me Saviour, lead me lest I stray Gently down the stream of time Lead me, Saviour, all the way.
