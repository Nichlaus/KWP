 O my heart sings today, sings for joy and gladness, Jesus saves, satisfies, banishes my sadness; Guilt is gone, peace is mine, peace like to a river, Jesus is wonderful, mighty to deliver CHORUS Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He, Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His name! Once a slave, now I^m free, free from condemnation, Jesus gives liberty and a full salvation; Now the sins of the past have been all forgiven, And my name is inscribed on the book of heaven. CHORUS Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He, Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His name! Living here with my Lord in a holy union, Day by day, all the way holding sweet communion; O what change grace hath wrought in my lowly station! Since my soul has received full and free salvation. CHORUS Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He, Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His name!
