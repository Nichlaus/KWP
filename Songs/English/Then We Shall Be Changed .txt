 We dwell in a house that's fashioned of clay Whose foundation is clay That will soon pass away But my tent will be changed Some glorious day for a building Eternal that will never pass away CHORUS Then we shall be changed oh glorious day Changed In a moment for the dead shall be raised Changed to be like Him This old house of clay,the trumpet shall sound Then we shall be changed. This old house of clay is too weak and so frail It makes us to stumble and falter and fail But God's ever faithful to His loved and His own Through Jesus He will give us a beautiful home. CHORUS Then we shall be changed oh glorious day Changed In a moment for the dead shall be raised Changed to be like Him This old house of clay,the trumpet shall sound Then we shall be changed.
