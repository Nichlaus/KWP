 I know there is a land of beautiful flowers, Where we will meet again when life is o^er Where we will while away the endless hours On heavens bright eternal shore. The prettiest beds of flowers will be blooming In the prettiest dream town I shall ever behold And the prettiest songs with the angels well be singing By the prettiest mansion made of purest gold. The prettiest robes and crowns we will all be wearing In the beautiful square beyond this world of trials Where the tree of life for us is awaiting By the prettiest mansion made of purest gold.
