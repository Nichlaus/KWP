 To Canaan's land,I'm on my way Where the soul never dies My darkest night will turn to day, Where the soul (of man) never dies.

CHORUS No sad farewells (dear friends,there'll be no sad farewells) No tear dimmed eyes (there'll be no dimmed eyes) Where all Is love (where all Is peace, and joy and love) And the soul never dies (and the soul never dies) A love-light beams across the foam Where the soul (of man) never dies It shines to light the shores of home Where the soul (of man) never dies. CHORUS No sad farewells (dear friends,there'll be no sad farewells) No tear dimmed eyes (there'll be no dimmed eyes) Where all Is love (where all Is peace, and joy and love) And the soul never dies (and the soul never dies) My life will end in deathless sleep Where the soul (of man)never dies And everlasting joys I'll reap Where the soul (of man) never dies. CHORUS No sad farewells (dear friends,there'll be no sad farewells) No tear dimmed eyes (there'll be no dimmed eyes) Where all Is love (where all Is peace, and joy and love) And the soul never dies (and the soul never dies) I'm on my way to that fair land Where the soul (of man) never dies Where there will be no parting hand And the soul (of man) never dies. CHORUS No sad farewells (dear friends,there'll be no sad farewells) No tear dimmed eyes (there'll be no dimmed eyes) Where all Is love (where all Is peace, and joy and love) And the soul never dies (and the soul never dies)
