 When peace like a river attendeth my way When sorrows like sea billows roll What ever my lot, thou has taught be to say It is well, it is well in my soul CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul Though satan should buffet, though trials should come Let this blest assurance control That Christ has regarded my helpless state And has shed His own blood for my soul CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought my sin, Not in part but the whole Is nailed to the cross, and bear it no more Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord Oh my soul. CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live If Jordan above me shall roll No pang shall be mine For in death as in life Thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul And lord haste the day when my faith shall be sight The clouds be rolled back as a scroll The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend Even so it is well with my soul CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul But Lord tis for thee For thy coming we wait The sky not the grave is our goal The shout of the angel The Voice of the Lord Blessed hope Blessed rest of my soul. CHORUS It is well, (it is well) With my soul It is well, it is well With my soul
