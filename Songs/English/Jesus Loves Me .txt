 Jesus loves me! this I know, For the Bible tells me so; Little ones to Him belong, They are weak but He is strong. CHORUS Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, The Bible tells me so. Jesus loves me! He who died, Heaven's gate to open wide; He will wash away my sin. Let His little child come in. CHORUS Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, The Bible tells me so. Jesus loves me! loves me still, Though I'm very weak and ill; From His shining throne on high, Comes to watch me where I lie. CHORUS Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, Yes, Jesus loves me, The Bible tells me so.
