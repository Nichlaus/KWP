 CHORUS It's worth it all to be His child To serve Him through the last long mile It's worth It all to feel His power, And to know He keeps us every Hour. Sometimes we're tried and things go wrong We sometimes say, Oh, Lord how long? Let's trust in Him and wear a smile, It's worth it all to be His child. CHORUS It's worth it all to be His child To serve Him through the last long mile It's worth It all to feel His power, And to know He keeps us every Hour. Although we bear, reproach and shame, It's worth it all for His dear name, The toils of life may rise and fall, But the love of God is worth it all. CHORUS It's worth it all to be His child To serve Him through the last long mile It's worth It all to feel His power, And to know He keeps us every Hour. When here on earth our race is run, We see the rays of the setting sun, When we shall hear that final call We^ll tell the world its been worth it all. CHORUS It's worth it all to be His child To serve Him through the last long mile It's worth It all to feel His power, And to know He keeps us every Hour.
