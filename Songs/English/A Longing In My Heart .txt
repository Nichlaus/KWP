 When I think of all the blessings Christ has given How He saved my soul and washed my sins away I have a longing in my heart to be with Jesus And I know His coming can't be too far away. CHORUS I have a longing In my heart to see the Lord I've a longing In my heart for His return Too much troubles here to bear, Too much worry, too much fear I've a longing in my heart to see the Lord. Many times my burdens seem so hard to carry Many times I have to smile to hide my tears, But in heaven there will be no cross to carry There will be no sorrow through the countless years. CHORUS I have a longing In my heart to see the Lord I've a longing In my heart for His return Too much troubles here to bear, Too much worry, too much fear I've a longing in my heart to see the Lord.
