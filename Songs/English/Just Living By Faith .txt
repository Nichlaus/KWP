 Lord when you saved me, by faith I was free I didn't know which way to go, But Lord you showed me; If I trust in your Word,Holy Word so divine, Just living by faith and walking by faith; I'll always be Thine. CHORUS Just living by faith,faith has no doubt, Just living by faith,by faith in the Lord, Things will work out, You'll have no more struggles,then make up your mind, Just living by faith, and willing by faith, His Word is more divine. Dear Lord you never,gave me reason to doubt, You were there all the time,that I was so blind Till by faith I reached out, By faith Lord I found you and by faith I can see, Just living by faith,and I know that by faith You have saved me.
