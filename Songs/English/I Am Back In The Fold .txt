 I was straying in the valley of the shadows of death I was lost and the light was so dim, But the good Shepherd loved me, and He sought me Till He found me. Now I am back in the fold again. CHORUS I am back in the fold,I'm sheltered from the cold, And I know I'll forever have a friend, For the good Shepherd loved us And He sought me till He found me, Now I'm back in the fold again. I was bending neath my burdens And my footsteps were sore, I was bound by the great chain of sin, Then the good Shepherd found me Took me up and unbound me, Now I'm back in the fold again. CHORUS I am back in the fold,I'm sheltered from the cold, And I know I'll forever have a friend, For the good Shepherd loved us And He sought me till He found me, Now I'm back in the fold again.
