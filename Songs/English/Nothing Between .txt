 Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, Naught of this world's delusive dream: I have renounced all sinful pleasure, Jesus is mine, there's nothing between. CHORUS Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, So that His blessed face may be seen; Nothing preventing the least of His favor, Keep the way clear! Let nothing between. Nothing between like worldly pleasure; Habits of life, though harmless they seem, Must not my heart from Him ever sever; He is my all, there's nothing between. CHORUS Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, So that His blessed face may be seen; Nothing preventing the least of His favor, Keep the way clear! Let nothing between. Nothing between, like pride or station; Self or friends shall not intervene; Though it may cost me much tribulation, I am resolved, there's nothing between. CHORUS Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, So that His blessed face may be seen; Nothing preventing the least of His favor, Keep the way clear! Let nothing between. Nothing between, even many hard trials. Though the whole world against me convene; Watching with prayer and much self-denial, I'll triumph at last, with nothing between. CHORUS Nothing between my soul and the Saviour, So that His blessed face may be seen; Nothing preventing the least of His favor, Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
