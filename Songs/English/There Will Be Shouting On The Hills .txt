 CHORUS There will be shouting on the hills of glory, Shouting on the hills, yes,shouting on the hills, When we reach that land of which we've heard the story, There will be shouting on the hills of God. What a happy time is coming When we reach our home in heaven And the burdens which we bear There we'll bear no more, When the angels sound the trumpets Calling us to those bright mansions There will be shouting on the everlasting shore. CHORUS There will be shouting on the hills of glory, Shouting on the hills, yes,shouting on the hills, When we reach that land of which we've heard the story, There will be shouting on the hills of God. When the saints begin to gather Round the Throne in that blessed city, And the angels there the songs of praise uphold Harps and golden bells will be ringing Saints of all the ages singing Such a meeting as we never saw before. CHORUS There will be shouting on the hills of glory, Shouting on the hills, yes,shouting on the hills, When we reach that land of which we've heard the story, There will be shouting on the hills of God. On that blessed happy morning, When all saints are risen again And when all our loved ones we will see again, In that happy land eternal, We will live in joys supernal, And with Jesus and the angels ever reign. CHORUS There will be shouting on the hills of glory, Shouting on the hills, yes,shouting on the hills, When we reach that land of which we've heard the story, There will be shouting on the hills of God.
