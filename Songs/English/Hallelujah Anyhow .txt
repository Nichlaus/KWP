 CHORUS Hallelujah, anyhow I'll never let my troubles get me down, Whatever problems life may bring I'll hold my head up high and sing; Hallelujah, anyhow. When you're in a valley dark and low Your friends so true and real where do they go, But if want to see your troubles fly, Just sing this song and hold your hands up high. CHORUS Hallelujah, anyhow I'll never let my troubles get me down, Whatever problems life may bring I'll hold my head up high and sing; Hallelujah, anyhow. Once I read about a man named Job Trials and afflictions laid him low, His wife told him why don^t you curse God and die, But instead he sang this song and held his head up high. CHORUS Hallelujah, anyhow I'll never let my troubles get me down, Whatever problems life may bring I'll hold my head up high and sing; Hallelujah, anyhow.
