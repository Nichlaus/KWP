 Like the woman at the well I was seeking, For things that would not satisfy Till when I heard my Saviour speaking; Draw from my well that never shall run dry. CHORUS Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up Lord, Come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole. There are millions in this world who are seeking For pleasures earthly things afford But none can match the wondrous treasures That I have in Jesus Christ my Lord. CHORUS Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up Lord, Come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole. So my brother if things this world gives you Leave longings that won't pass away My precious Lord will come and save you If you kneel to Him and humbly pray. CHORUS Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up Lord, Come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.
