Open my eyes, that I may seeGlimpses of truth Thou hast for me;Place in my hands the wonderful keyThat shall unclasp, and set me free.CHORUSSilently now I wait for Thee,Ready, my God, Thy will to see;Open my eyes, illumine me,Spirit Divine!Open my ears, that I may hearVoices of truth Thou sendest clear;And while the wave-notes fall on my ear,Everything false will disappear.CHORUSSilently now I wait for Thee,Ready, my God, Thy will to see;Open my eyes, illumine me,Spirit Divine!Open my mouth, and let me bearGladly the warm truth everywhere;Open my heart, and let me prepare,Love with Thy children thus to share.CHORUSSilently now I wait for Thee,Ready, my God, Thy will to see;Open my eyes, illumine me,Spirit Divine!
