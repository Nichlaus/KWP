 I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in; And then a little Light from heaven filled my soul; It bathed my heart in love And wrote my name above, And just a little talk with Jesus Made me whole. CHORUS Now let us have a little talk with Jesus Let us tell Him all about our troubles, He will hear our faintest cry He will answer by and by; Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning, And you know a little fire is burning, You will find a little talk With Jesus makes it right. Sometimes my path seems drear, Without a ray of cheer; And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day; The mists of sin may rise, And hide the starry skies, But just a little talk with Jesus Clears the way. CHORUS Now let us have a little talk with Jesus Let us tell Him all about our troubles, He will hear our faintest cry He will answer by and by; Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning, And you know a little fire is burning, You will find a little talk With Jesus makes it right. I may have doubts and fears, My eyes may be filled with tears, But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night, I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care, And just a little talk with Jesus Makes it right. CHORUS Now let us have a little talk with Jesus Let us tell Him all about our troubles, He will hear our faintest cry He will answer by and by; Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning, And you know a little fire is burning, You will find a little talk With Jesus makes it right.
