 It shall flow like a river. It shall fall like the rain. It shall rise as the dew in morning o^er the plain; For the knowledge of the Lord shall fill all earth When the Spirit of the Lord shall fall. Flow, river, flow; flow, river, flow; Flow out through the nations wherever man may go; Cause life to spring forth, that all men may know That You're the river of the Spirit; Oh,flow, river, flow.
