 In the heart of London city, 'Mid the dwellings of the poor, These bright golden words were uttered: I have Christ! What want I more? CHORUS I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? Spoken by a lonely woman, Dying on a garret floor; Having not one earthly comfort: I have Christ! What want I more? CHORUS I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? Oh, her words will live forever; I repeat them over and over; God delights to hear me saying, I have Christ! What want I more? CHORUS I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? Oh, my dear, my fellow sinners, High and low, and rich and poor; Can you say, with deep thanksgiving, I have Christ! What want I more? CHORUS I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? Look away from earth^s attractions, All it's joys will soon be over; Trust Him now, and say with gladness: I have Christ! What want I more? CHORUS I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more? I have Christ! What want I more?
