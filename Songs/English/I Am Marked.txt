I have lost my reputation since I turned my back on sin,And a lot of friends went from me, since I let my Saviour in;Now they pass me by unknown, when they once passed with a smile;Now they say I'm foolish, and they say I'm out of style.CHORUSI am marked, marked, marked,I am marked, now wherever I go;I am marked, marked, marked,Just what I am everyone seems to know.I am sealed, sealed, sealed,I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!I am His, and I know He is mine.Well, they say my life is ruined, and my talent thrown away,My talent thrown away,And they cannot understand it, for I had such plans one day;But I know what I surrendered when promised I'd go through;And I gained far more glory since God made me over new.CHORUSI am marked, marked, marked,I am marked, now wherever I go;I am marked, marked, marked,Just what I am everyone seems to know.I am sealed, sealed, sealed,I am sealed by His Spirit Divine;Oh glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen!I am His, and I know He is mine.
