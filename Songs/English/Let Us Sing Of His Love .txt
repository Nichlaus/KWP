 Let us sing of His love once again, Of the love that can never decay, Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain, Till we praise Him again in that day. CHORUS In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore; In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore. There is cleansing and healing for all Who will wash in the life-giving flood, There is life everlasting and joy At the right hand of God through the blood. CHORUS In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore; In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore. Even now while we taste of His love, We are filled with delight at His Name; But what will it be when above We shall join in the song of the Lamb? CHORUS In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore; In the sweet ... by-and-by We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
