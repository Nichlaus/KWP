 He is the fountain for a thirsty soul He is the healer and, so much more When my heart is broken by this world^s demands The pieces are mended with one scarred hand. CHORUS And when I can't stand I have to lean And when I can't see I must believe The great physician's touch Is the balm that can mend broken hearts With one scarred hands. It's a hand that hangs this whole world in plan Oh a hand that - was scarred just to give me grace And to think a hand that holds the storms Is strong enough,to mend one broken heart. CHORUS And when I can't stand I have to lean And when I can't see I must believe The great physician's touch Is the balm that can mend broken hearts With one scarred hands.
