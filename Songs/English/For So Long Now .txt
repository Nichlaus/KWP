 For so long now we've dreamed about the day That soon shall come When He would split the eastern sky And gather all His jewels home. I've gone too far to turn back now At last the victory is almost won I've fought the fight I've carried the faith Thank God I'm almost home. CHORUS The angels play the harps so loud The trumpet rings loud and clear The day we've dreamed of for so long That day is almost here. You ask me how I know it's real These things I just can't explain For all I know is that heavenly tag I can feel when my heart prays. It won't be long and I'll see old Jordan Drifting at my feet Then I'll behold the light of home It's over my journey is now complete. CHORUS The angels play the harps so loud The trumpet rings loud and clear The day we've dreamed of for so long That day is almost here.
