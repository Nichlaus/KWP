 When troubles are on my way, I can't tell my night from day, When am tossed from side to side, Like a ship on a raging tide CHORUS I don't worry, I don't fret God has never, never failed me yet Troubles come from time to time But, that's all right, Am not the worrying type, because, I've got confidence, God Is gonna see me thru No matter what the case may be, I know I know He's. gonna fix it for me. Some folks wonder how I smile, Even through I am going through trials How can I have a song When everything is going wrong. CHORUS I don't worry, I don^t fret God has never, never failed me yet Troubles come from time to time But, that's all right, Am not the worrying type, because, I've got confidence, God Is gonna see me thru No matter what the case may be, I know I know He's. gonna fix it for me.
