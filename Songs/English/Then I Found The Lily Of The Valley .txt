 I thought I had a bed of Roses Everything I did was on my own I thought the world was mine And everything was fine But I saw my roses wilt and fade away. CHORUS Then I found the Lily of the Valley In the shadow of the cross I saw Him bloom He took away my fears And wiped away my tears For the Lily of the Valley is my Lord. I saw the Lily of the Valley From a world of sin I tried to flee Oh everything went wrong It seemed that hope was gone Then the Lily of the Valley rescued me. CHORUS Then I found the Lily of the Valley In the shadow of the cross I saw Him bloom He took away my fears And wiped away my tears For the Lily of the Valley is my Lord.
