 Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling, Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling None of these shall move me from Beulah land. CHORUS I'm living, on the mountain,underneath a cloudless sky I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry Oh yes I'm feasting, on the manna from a bountiful supply For I am dwelling in Beulah land. Far below the storm of doubt upon the world's beating Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand Safe am I within the castle of God's Word retreating. Nothing then can reach me in Beulah land. CHORUS I'm living, on the mountain,underneath a cloudless sky I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry Oh yes I'm feasting, on the manna from a bountiful supply For I am dwelling in Beulah land. Let the stormy breezes blow,their cry cannot alarm me I am safely sheltered here protected by God's hand Here the sun always shining,here there's naught can harm me. I am safe forever in Beulah land. CHORUS I'm living, on the mountain,underneath a cloudless sky I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry Oh yes I'm feasting, on the manna from a bountiful supply For I am dwelling in Beulah land. Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation Hearing now his blessed voice, I see the way He planned Dwelling in the spirit here, I learn of full salvation Gladly will I tarry in Beulah land. CHORUS I'm living, on the mountain,underneath a cloudless sky I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry Oh yes I'm feasting, on the manna from a bountiful supply For I am dwelling in Beulah land.
