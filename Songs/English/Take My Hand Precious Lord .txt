 When my way groweth drear, Precious Lord, linger near, When my life is almost gone; Hear my cry, hear my call, Hold my hand, lest I fall, Take my hand precious Lord, lead me Home. CHORUS Precious Lord, take my hand, Lead me on, let me stand, I am tired, I am weak, I am worn; Through the storm, through the night, Lead me on to the Light, Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me Home. When the shadows appear, And the night draweth near, And the day is past and gone; At the river I stand, Guide my feet, hold my hand, Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me Home. CHORUS Precious Lord, take my hand, Lead me on, let me stand, I am tired, I am weak, I am worn; Through the storm, through the night, Lead me on to the Light, Take my hand, precious Lord,lead me Home. Nearing life-journey's end Be my guide, be my friend, Give me strength, Lord to overcome; I'll not go all alone, For by grace,I'm Thine own; Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me Home. CHORUS Precious Lord, take my hand, Lead me on, let me stand, I am tired, I am weak, I am worn; Through the storm, through the night, Lead me on to the Light, Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me Home.
