 I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart, I will enter His courts with praise; I will say this is the day that the Lord hath made, I will rejoice for He hath made me glad. He hath made me glad, He hath made me glad, I will rejoice for He hath made me glad; He hath made me glad, He hath made me glad, I will rejoice for He hath made me glad.
