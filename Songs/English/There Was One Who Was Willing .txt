 There was one who was willing To die in my stead That a soul so unworthy might live And the path to the cross He was willing to tread All the sins of my life to forgive CHORUS They are nailed to the cross They are nailed to the cross Oh how much He was willing to bear With that anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross And He carried all my sins with Him there He is tender and loving and patient with me While He cleanses my heart of its dross But theres no condemnation, I know I am free For my sins are all nailed to the cross CHORUS They are nailed to the cross They are nailed to the cross Oh how much He was willing to bear With that anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross And He carried all my sins with Him there I will cling to my Saviour, and never depart I will joyfully journey each day With a songs on my lips and a song in my heart That my sins have been taken away CHORUS They are nailed to the cross They are nailed to the cross Oh how much He was willing to bear With that anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross And He carried all my sins with Him there
