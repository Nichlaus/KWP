 I had nothing but heartaches and troubles I was seeking for fortune and fame I had nothing but doubts and confusion But now I have everything. CHORUS Everything I need to make me happy, I have Jesus to show me the way,  He has saved me and given me life eternal,  And now I have everything.  I was making big plans for my future,  I was living my life time in vain,  Then I prayed for life's only meaning,  And now I have everything.  CHORUS  Everything I need to make me happy,  I have Jesus to show me the way,  He has saved me and given me life eternal,  And now I have everything.
