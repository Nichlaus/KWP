 I can see youre in the battle Yes the war still rages on You dont have to be defeated Though youre struggling to hold on Oh my brother, my sister I am here to stand with you You are still an overcomer And by faith, youll make it through Fight on, fight on Through the darkest night When hope seems nearly gone In the Name of Jesus The battle will be won Fight on weary soldier fight on Theres a kingdom in the making So keep holding to you sword for your weapons are so mighty Through the spirit of the Lord Oh be strong and take courage He will never let you fall In the morning light of victory Youll say, it was worth it all.
