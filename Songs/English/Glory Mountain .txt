 Glory Mountain We have looked for His coming for many years Miles filled with happiness and many filled with tears But His promise is sure that He will return We are looking for the day of the Lord. CHORUS Glory mountain Is not far away Glory mountain, we will see the Saviour's face The hope of all ages and of every race Glory mountain,we may see today. High on a mountain, He went away His disciples were crying,and they were afraid He gave them assurance to comfort all men His feet will touch that mountain and come again. CHORUS Glory mountain Is not far away Glory mountain, we will see the Saviour's face The hope of all ages and of every race Glory mountain,we may see today.
