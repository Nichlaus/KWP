 I am getting weary of this lonesome road I tread, And everyday I'm longing more to be with God Just to leave this world of sin and all it's strife And to walk into the heaven realm of life. CHORUS There's a great magnet flying from above And there's nothing to hold me here below, I'll rise to meet Him in the air When the final call comes for me to go. As I gaze into the starry skies above How l marvel at the Mighty Word of God Just to know He is living in my soul It is the greatest gift any man could own. CHORUS There's a great magnet flying from above And there's nothing to hold me here below, I'll rise to meet Him in the air When the final call comes for me to go.
