 Oh the blessed contemplation When with trouble here I sigh I have a home beyond the river; That I'll enter by and by. CHORUS I have a home beyond the river I have a mansion bright and fair I have a home beyond the river; I will dwell with Jesus there Oh how sweet 'twill be to meet there, All the ransomed hosts above; Sweeter still to see the Saviour, Praise Him for redeeming love. CHORUS I have a home beyond the river I have a mansion bright and fair I have a home beyond the river; I will dwell with Jesus there Tho' the world is filled with sorrows, And the teardrops often fall; There will be but joy and gladness, Safe inside the jasper wall. CHORUS I have a home beyond the river I have a mansion bright and fair I have a home beyond the river; I will dwell with Jesus there Tho' the hills are rough and stormy And the valleys dark and cold; I must walk the path before me; It will some day turn to gold. CHORUS I have a home beyond the river I have a mansion bright and fair I have a home beyond the river; I will dwell with Jesus there
