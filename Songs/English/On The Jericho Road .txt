 As you travel along Jericho road, Does the world seem all wrong And heavy your load? Just bring it to Christ You sins all confess On the Jericho road, Your hear He will bless. CHORUS On the Jericho road There's room for just two No more and no less Just Jesus and you Each burden He'll bear Each sorrow He'll share There's never a care For Jesus Is there. On the Jericho road, Blind Bartimeus sat His life was void, so empty and flat But Jesus appeared One word brought him sight On the Jericho road Christ banished his blindness. CHORUS On the Jericho road There's room for just two No more and no less Just Jesus and you Each burden He'll bear Each sorrow He'll share There's never a care For Jesus Is there Oh brother to you this message I bring Though hope may be gone He'll cause you to sing At Jesus command sins shackles must fall On the Jericho road Will you answer His call. CHORUS On the Jericho road There's room for just two No more and no less Just Jesus and you Each burden He'll bear Each sorrow He'll share There's never a care For Jesus Is there
