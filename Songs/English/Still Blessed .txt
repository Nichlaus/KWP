 Sometimes I wake up in the morning I see I made it through the night I listen for my family sure enough Theyre alright As we gather round the table Bow our heads in thankfulness With tear filled my eyes my heart still blessed Theres never a day He doesnt give me all I need Even when I wake up to the storm My soul cries peace Sometimes I try to count them Theyre too many I confess So with arms upraised I just say still blessed Now I dont want to leave my family I dont want to leave my friends Oh but lately I've been homesick How I long to just be with Him So in the morning should you find me With eyes closed in death Oh what victory, what glory still blessed Sometimes I try to count them Theyre too many I confess So with arms upraised I just say still blessed
