 Oh Lord hear my cry, For some day I know I'll die Tell the angels I'm on my way, I am so weary here below, Bound beneath this heavy load, Tell the angels I'm on my way CHORUS Oh tell the angels I'm on my way, For I'm coming home to stay, Tell the angels, I'm on my way, On heaven's peaceful shore, Where we'll never part no more, Tell the angels I'm on my way. Thank you Lord you heard my plea, Saved my soul and rescued me, Tell the angels I'm on my way, There's a greater place I know, It's a place I long to go, Tell the angels I'm on my way. CHORUS Oh tell the angels I'm on my way, For I'm coming home to stay, Tell the angels, I'm on my way, On heaven's peaceful shore, Where we'll never part no more, Tell the angels I'm on my way.
