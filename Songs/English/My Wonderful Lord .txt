 I have found a deep peace, I never had known, And a joy this world could not afford, Since I yielded control of my body and soul To my wonderful,wonderful Lord. CHORUS My wonderful Lord,my wonderful Lord; By angels and seraphs In heaven adored; I bow at Thy Shrine, My Saviour divine, My wonderful, wonderful Lord. I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee, That my will be in perfect accord; With Thine own sovereign will my desires to fulifil My wonderful, wonderful Lord. CHORUS My wonderful Lord,my wonderful Lord; By angels and seraphs In heaven adored; I bow at Thy Shrine, My Saviour divine, My wonderful, wonderful Lord. All the talents I have, I have laid at Thy feet, Thy approval shall be my reward; Be it too great or small I surrender it all, To my wonderful, wonderful Lord. CHORUS My wonderful Lord,my wonderful Lord; By angels and seraphs In heaven adored; I bow at Thy Shrine, My Saviour divine, My wonderful, wonderful Lord. Thou art dearer to me than the fairest of earth, Thou omnipotent life giving word; Oh Thou ancient of days, Thou art worthy all praise My wonderful, wonderful Lord. CHORUS My wonderful Lord,my wonderful Lord; By angels and seraphs In heaven adored; I bow at Thy Shrine, My Saviour divine, My wonderful, wonderful Lord.
