 We're looking for His coming,in the clouds of heaven, Coming back to earth to catch away His own; Then may we all be ready,when midnight cry is given, To go and reign with Christ on His throne. CHORUS Gladly may we herald the message Of His blessed appearing, Soon He's coming in glory,Tell to one and all; Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, Why slumber when the end is nearing, But get ready for the final call. We're longing for the glory that awaits the faithful, Who shall overcome,and ev'ry conflict win; Press ever bravely onward,the prize is life eternal To all who win the fight over sin. CHORUS Gladly may we herald the message Of His blessed appearing, Soon He's coming in glory,Tell to one and all; Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, Why slumber when the end is nearing, But get ready for the final call. We're praying for the advent of our blessed Savior, Who has promised life to all who trust His grace; His coming now is pending,the message being given, And soon we'll see our Lord face to face. CHORUS Gladly may we herald the message Of His blessed appearing, Soon He's coming in glory,Tell to one and all; Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, Why slumber when the end is nearing, But get ready for the final call. We see the signs appearing of His blessed coming, Lo,behold the fig leaves now becoming green; The gospel of His kingdom has gone to ev'ry nation; That we are near the end can be seen. CHORUS Gladly may we herald the message Of His blessed appearing, Soon He's coming in glory,Tell to one and all; Then awake, ye saints of the Lord, Why slumber when the end is nearing, But get ready for the final call.
