 Day of judgement may be nearing What a morning that will be, There will be safety then in Jesus, Rock of Ages cleft for me. CHORUS Oh my loving brother when the world's on fire, Don't you want God^s bosom to be your pillow, Hide me ever,in the Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me. When the dawning of that morning Breaks in fury on the world, Rocks and mountains, streets and valleys In confusion will be hurled. CHORUS Oh my loving brother when the world's on fire, Don't you want God^s bosom to be your pillow, Hide me ever,in the Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me. Sinners trembling, saints rejoicing Each departing to his place, All the ransomed Christ will gather, He has saved them by His grace. CHORUS Oh my loving brother when the world's on fire, Don't you want God^s bosom to be your pillow, Hide me ever,in the Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me.
