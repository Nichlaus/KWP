 Once from my poor sin sick soul Christ did every burden roll Now I walk redeemed and whole Hand in hand with Jesus. CHORUS Hand In hand we walk each day Hand In hand along the way Walking thus I cannot stray Hand in hand with Jesus. When the stars are backward rolled And His face I shall behold I will tread the streets of gold Hand in hand with Jesus. CHORUS Hand In hand we walk each day Hand In hand along the way Walking thus I cannot stray Hand in hand with Jesus.
