 A wonderful time is just ahead, The Lord Whom we love and own Will open the gates of gloryland Revealing His glory throne. CHORUS A wonderful time for you, A wonderful time for me; If we are prepared to meet Jesus the King, A wonderful time it will be. A wonderful time is just ahead, Our conflicts and trials passed; Our wilderness journey at an end, Safe home everyone at last. CHORUS A wonderful time for you, A wonderful time for me; If we are prepared to meet Jesus the King, A wonderful time it will be. A wonderful time is just ahead, The groans of creation cease; And all that is held in bondage now The Lord will that day release. CHORUS A wonderful time for you, A wonderful time for me; If we are prepared to meet Jesus the King, A wonderful time it will be.
