 Wither,pilgrims, are you going, Going each with staff in hand? We are going on a journey, Going to our King's command, Over hills and plains and valleys, We are going to His palace, (Repeat) Going to the better land. Tell us,pilgrims, what you hope for In that far-off, better land? Spotless robes, and crowns of glory, From a Saviour's loving hand. We shall drink of life's clear river, We shall dwell with God for ever, (Repeat) In that bright, that better land. Pilgrims, may we travel with you To that bright and better land? Come and welcome, come and welcome, Welcome to our pilgrim band. Come, oh, come! And do not leave us; Christ is waiting to receive us, (Repeat) In that bright, that better land.
