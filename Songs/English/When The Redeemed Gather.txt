I am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on high,When the redeemed are gathering in;How we'll raise the heavenly anthem in that city in the skyWhen the redeemed are gathering in.CHORUSWhen the redeemed are gathering inWashed like snow, and free from all sin;How we shout, and how we will sing,When the redeemed are gathering in.There will be great procession over on the streets of gold,When the redeemed are gathering in;Oh what music, O what singing,When the redeemed are gathering in.CHORUSWhen the redeemed are gathering inWashed like snow, and free from all sin;How we shout, and how we will sing,When the redeemed are gathering in.Saints will sing redemption's story with their voices clear and strongWhen the redeemed are gathering in;Then the angels all will listen, for they cannot join that song,When the redeemed are gathering in.CHORUSWhen the redeemed are gathering inWashed like snow, and free from all sin;How we shout, and how we will sing,When the redeemed are gathering in.Then the Saviour will give orders to prepare the banquet board,When the redeemed are gathering in;And we'll hear His invitation,Come, ye blessed of the Lord,When the redeemed are gathering in.CHORUSWhen the redeemed are gathering inWashed like snow, and free from all sin;How we shout, and how we will sing,When the redeemed are gathering in.
