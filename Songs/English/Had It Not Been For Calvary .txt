 Just suppose God searched through Heaven, He couldn't find one willing to be, The supreme sacrifice that was needed, To buy eternal life for you and me. CHORUS Had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary, And had it not been for the old rugged cross, Had it not been for a man called Jesus, Then forever my soul would be lost. Oh I'm so glad He was willing to drink that bitter cup Although He prayed Father let it pass from me, And I'm so glad He never called Heaven's angels. From my hands pull these nails that torment me. CHORUS Had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary, And had it not been for the old rugged cross, Had it not been for a man called Jesus, Then forever my soul would be lost.
