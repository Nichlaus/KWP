 Nations are breaking, Israel's awaking, The signs that the prophets foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with horrors encumbered; Eternity soon will unfold. CHORUS The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! Your redemption is near. The fig tree is growing; Jerusalem's restoring Her national life, long dethroned; Today she is calling, her latter rain's falling. Return, O dispersed, to your own. CHORUS The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! Your redemption is near. Heaven's powers are shaking, and many are mistaking God's meaning to be of the sky; God's Church is the power that's shaking this hour; The day of redemption is nigh. CHORUS The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! Your redemption is near. False prophets are lying. God's Truth they^re denying, That Jesus the Christ is our God; Though this generation spurns God's revelation, We'll walk where the apostles have trod. CHORUS The day of redemption is near, Men's hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! Your redemption is near.
