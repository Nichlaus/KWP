 Have you been baptized into the Body? Baptized with the Holy Ghost; There is but one way to enter in it, Just as they did on Pentecost. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide. There is but one Church, Bride or Body, And into it we're all baptized; By the one, true, promised Holy Spirit; Though by the world we^re all despised. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide. Every creed has claimed to be the Body, But the plumb line proved untrue All their dreams, for God has so determined To bring His Sons true Bride to view. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide. Many thought that they were in the Body, 'Till the Holy Ghost had come; When the Word of God was opened to them, They entered in, and yet there's room. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide. Those who died before the Holy Spirit Came upon us from on high, May, by faith with Saints of old departed, Arise to meet Him in the sky. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide. When the Bridegroom comes, will you be ready; And your vessel all filled and bright? You will be among the foolish virgins If you do not walk in the light. CHORUS Are you in the Church triumphant? Are you in the Saviour's Bride? Come and be baptized into the Body, And forevermore abide.
