 I wandered so aimless, My life filled with sin, I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in; Then Jesus came like a stranger at night; Praise the Lord, I saw the light. CHORUS I saw the Light, I saw the Light, No more In darkness,no more In night; Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight, Praise the Lord, I saw the Light. Just like a blind man I wandered along, Worries and cares I called for my own; Then like a blind man Whom God gave back his sight, Praise the Lord I saw the Light. CHORUS I saw the Light, I saw the Light, No more In darkness,no more In night; Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight, Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.
