 I must have the Saviour with me, For I dare not walk alone, I must feel His presence near me, And His arm around me thrown. CHORUS Then my soul shall fear no ill Let Him lead me where He will I will go without a murmur, And His footsteps follow still. I must have the Saviour with me, For my faith, at best, is weak; He can whisper words of comfort, That no other voice can speak. CHORUS Then my soul shall fear no ill Let Him lead me where He will I will go without a murmur, And His footsteps follow still. I must have the Saviour with me, In the onward march of life' Through the tempest and the sunshine, Through the battle and the strife. CHORUS Then my soul shall fear no ill Let Him lead me where He will I will go without a murmur, And His footsteps follow still. I must have the Saviour with me, And His eye the way must guide, Till I reach the vale of Jordan, Till I cross the rolling tide. CHORUS Then my soul shall fear no ill Let Him lead me where He will I will go without a murmur, And His footsteps follow still
