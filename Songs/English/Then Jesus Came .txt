 One sat alone beside the highway begging. His eyes were blind, the light he could not see; He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows, Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee. CHORUS When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay. From home and friends the evil spirits drove him, Among the tombs he dwelt in misery; He cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him. Then Jesus came and set the captive free. CHORUS When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay. Unclean! Unclean! The leper cried in torment, The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near; The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim, Then Jesus came and cast out every fear. CHORUS When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay. So men today have found the Saviour able, They could not conquer passion,lust and sin; Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely, Then Jesus came and dwelt Himself within. CHORUS When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.
