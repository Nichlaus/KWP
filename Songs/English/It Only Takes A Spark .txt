 It will only takes a spark to get the fire burning And soon all those around can warm up to its glowing That's how it is with God's love Once you've experienced it, You spread His love, to every one You want to pass it on. What a wondrous time is spring When all the trees are budding, The birds begin to sing The flowers start their blooming That's how it is with God's love Once you've experienced it, You want to sing it's fresh like spring You want to pass it on. I wish for you my friends This happiness that I've found You can depend on Him It matters not where you are bound I'll shout it on the mountain tops I want the world to know The Lord of love has come to me I want to pass it on.
