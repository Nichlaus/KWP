 Far away in the depth of my spirit tonight Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm; In celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls Over my soul like an infinite calm. CHORUS Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In fathomless billows of love. What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace, Buried deep in the heart of my soul; So secure that no power can mine it away, While the years of eternity roll. CHORUS Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray In fathomless billows of love. I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace, Resting sweetly in Jesus' control; For I'm kept from all danger by night and by day, And His glory is flooding my soul. CHORUS Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In fathomless billows of love. And methinks when I rise to that City of peace, Where the Author of peace I shall see. That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing, In that heavenly kingdom shall be. CHORUS Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In fathomless billows of love. Ah! Soul, are you here without comfort and rest, Marching down the rough pathway of time? Make Jesus your friend ere the shadows grow dark; Oh, accept this sweet peace so sublime. CHORUS Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above; Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In fathomless billows of love.
