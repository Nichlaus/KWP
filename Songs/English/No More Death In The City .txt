 There is a song I ought to sing within my heart The city for people who are born again, Born of water, spirit and the blood of the Lamb The city is for people who are born again. CHORUS No more death in the city No more pain the homeland No crying, neither sorrows Oh, brother, live a holy life Sister, live a holy life. Apostle Paul sang this song I sing The city is for people who are born again And so I sing to you this song my friends, The city is for people who are born again. CHORUS No more death in the city No more pain the homeland No crying, neither sorrows Oh, brother, live a holy life Sister, live a holy life. My brother come to Jesus for the days are gone The city is for people who are born again For just a little moment and the trumpet will sound The city is for people who are born again. CHORUS No more death in the city No more pain the homeland No crying, neither sorrows Oh, brother, live a holy life Sister, live a holy life.
