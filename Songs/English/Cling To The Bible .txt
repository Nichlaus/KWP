 Cling to the Bible,though all else be taken; Lose not its precepts so precious and pure; Souls that are sleeping its tidings awaken: Life from the dead in its promises sure. CHORUS Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Our lamp and our guide! Cling to the Bible!-this jewel and treasure Brings life eternal, and saves fallen man; Surely its value no mortal can measure: Seek for its blessing, O soul,while you can! CHORUS Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Our lamp and our guide! Lamp for the feet that in by-ways have wandered, Guide for the youth that would otherwise fall; Hope for the sinner whose life has been squandered; Staff for the aged, and best Book for all! CHORUS Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible! Our lamp and our guide!
