 When I was down and needed Someone Someone to keep me every day It was then and then that I found my Jesus I am so glad that He came my way. CHORUS Christ Is my sunshine, my only sunshine, He makes me happy,when the skies are grey He changed my life and my ways completely, So,please don't take my sunshine away. I^m happy now with Jesus near me, A friend is He, a friend indeed, The worldly friends may all forsake me, My Jesus will be all I'll need. CHORUS Christ Is my sunshine, my only sunshine, He makes me happy,when the skies are grey He changed my life and my ways completely, So,please don't take my sunshine away. I'll always love Him and sing His praises, He'll be with me throughout the day, At night He'll guide me I won^t be lonely Please don't take my sunshine away. CHORUS Christ Is my sunshine, my only sunshine, He makes me happy,when the skies are grey He changed my life and my ways completely, So,please don't take my sunshine away.
