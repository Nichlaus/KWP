 CHORUS And Jesus said come to the waters Stand by my side, I know you're thirsty You won't be denied I felt every tear drop When in darkness you cried And I strove to remind you, That for those tears I died. You said you'd come To share all my sorrows You said you'd be there, For all my tomorrow; I came so close to sending you away But just like you promised You came here to stay I just had to pray. CHORUS And Jesus said come to the waters Stand by my side, I know you're thirsty You won't be denied I felt every tear drop When in darkness you cried And I strove to remind you, That for those tears I died. Your goodness so great, I can't understand, And dear Lord I know, That all this was planned I know you're here now And always will be; Your love loosed my chains And now I am free But Jesus why me? CHORUS And Jesus said come to the waters Stand by my side, I know you're thirsty You won't be denied I felt every tear drop When in darkness you cried And I strove to remind you, That for those tears I died. Saviour I give you My life and my soul, I know that without God, I'd never be whole, Saviour you opened all the right doors And I thank you and praise you From earth's humble shores Take me I'm yours. CHORUS And Jesus said come to the waters Stand by my side, I know you're thirsty You won't be denied I felt every tear drop When in darkness you cried And I strove to remind you, That for those tears I died.
