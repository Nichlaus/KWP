 You have longed for sweet peace, And for faith to increase, And have earnestly, fervently prayed But you cannot have rest,or be perfectly blessed Till your all on the altar is laid. CHORUS Is your heart on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blessed And have peace and sweet rest, As you yield Him your body and soul. Would you walk with the Lord, In the light of His word, And have peace and contentment always You must do His sweet will To be free from all ill When your all on the altar is laid. CHORUS Is your heart on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blessed And have peace and sweet rest, As you yield Him your body and soul. Oh we never can know, What the Lord can bestow, Of the blessings of which we have prayed Till our body and soul He doth fully control And our all on the altar is laid. CHORUS Is your heart on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blessed And have peace and sweet rest, As you yield Him your body and soul. Who can tell of the love, He will send from above, And how happy our hearts will be made Of the fellowship sweet, We shall share at His feet, When our all on the altar is laid. CHORUS Is your heart on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blessed And have peace and sweet rest, As you yield Him your body and soul.
