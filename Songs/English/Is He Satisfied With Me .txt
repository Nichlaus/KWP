 Do you ever search your heart,as you watch the day depart? Is there something way down deep you're trying to hide? If this day should be the end and eternity begins, When the Book is open wide,would the Lord be satisfied? CHORUS Is He satisfied, is He satisfied? Is He satisfied with me? Have I done my best,have I stood the test? ls He satisfied with me. When my Lord shall come again, When He walks and talks with men What if every friend He had were just like me Would He find a welcome heart or Would He go away in tears? Am I all that I should be,is He satisfied with me? CHORUS Is He satisfied, is He satisfied? Is He satisfied with me? Have I done my best,have I stood the test? ls He satisfied with me. Feeble is the lamb of fame, By which men inscribe their name On the walls of time for other men to see, Though they boast of wealth and praise, None can help them in the end When the angels hear my plea, Would the Lord be satisfied? CHORUS Is He satisfied, is He satisfied? Is He satisfied with me? Have I done my best,have I stood the test? ls He satisfied with me.
