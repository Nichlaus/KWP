 Praise God I live in Beulah land, My house will the storms with stand It is not built on sinking sand, My home is on the Rock. CHORUS My home is on the Rock The everlasting love I do not fear when the storms are near My home Is on the Rock. When come life's trials thick and fast, When clouds are over my pathway; It is not built on sinking sand, My home is on the Rock. CHORUS My home is on the Rock The everlasting love I do not fear when the storms are near My home Is on the Rock. When troubles come that would appall, When other buildings round me fail; It is not built on sinking sand, My home is on the Rock. CHORUS My home is on the Rock The everlasting love I do not fear when the storms are near My home Is on the Rock. And when my time has come to go, I'll have a mansion in the sky; It is not built on sinking sand, My home is on the Rock. CHORUS My home is on the Rock The everlasting love I do not fear when the storms are near My home Is on the Rock.
