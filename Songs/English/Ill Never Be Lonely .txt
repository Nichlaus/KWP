 Lonely days and lonely nights Filled with despair Caused me to long for someone who cares Then I heard Christ say to me This promise I've made Lo I am with you now and forever Be not afraid CHORUS Ill never be lonely again Never again For I have opened my hear door to Him So Ill brush away my tears And forget my foolish ways Ill never be lonely again Never again If youre longing for a friend Loving and true Turn to the saviour Hes waiting for you He will do the same for you As He dis for me Hell never leave you Never forsake you Trust Him and see CHORUS Ill never be lonely again Never again For I have opened my hear door to Him So Ill brush away my tears And forget my foolish ways Ill never be lonely again Never again
