 I hear the Savior say, Thy strength indeed is small, Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all. CHORUS Jesus paid it all. All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow. Lord, now indeed I find Thy power, and Thine alone, Can change the leper's spots, And melt the heart of stone. CHORUS Jesus paid it all. All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow. Since nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim, I'll wash my garments white In the blood of Calvery's Lamb. CHORUS Jesus paid it all. All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow.
