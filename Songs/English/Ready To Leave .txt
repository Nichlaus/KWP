 Some folks are building homes down here and planning ahead, So busy with their fortunes, They forget what Jesus said, About the wars and earthquakes, And the fig tree budding leaves, But there's a group of people getting ready to leave. CHORUS Ready to leave in the twinkling of an eye, Making investments In the bank up In the sky, Happy preparations, not a reason to grieve, Are you in that number getting ready to leave? Sinner,what's the reason for your needless delay? While you're hesitating Christ could come just any day. Heed the Saviour calling,make your way to Calvary, And get in that number getting ready to leave. CHORUS Ready to leave in the twinkling of an eye, Making investments In the bank up In the sky, Happy preparations, not a reason to grieve, Are you in that number getting ready to leave?
