 Many times in my childhood,when we travelled so far, By nightfall how weary I'd grown Father's arm would slip around me, So gently He'd say,my child we're going home. CHORUS Going home, I am going home There is nothing to hold me here, While I've caught a glimpse of that heavenly land, Praise God, I am going home. Now the twilight is fading and the day soon will end I get homesick for Father I long But my Father has led me each step of the way And now we're going home. CHORUS Going home, I am going home There is nothing to hold me here, While I've caught a glimpse of that heavenly land, Praise God, I am going home. Oh my heart gets so heavy and I'm longing to see, All my loved ones and friends I have known Every step draws me nearer to the land of my dreams, Praise God I am going home. CHORUS Going home, I am going home There is nothing to hold me here, While I've caught a glimpse of that heavenly land, Praise God, I am going home.
