 There was a man in olden days, Elijah was His name, Because the sin did so abound He prayed and stopped the rain, And for three years or more were told, They never had a shower, For God in heaven answered then, Elijah's prayer of power. CHORUS Elijah's God still lives today Oh blessed be His name And when His children to Him pray He answers still the same, Yes He controls the universe All things obey His word, And when by faith we call on Him, Our humble prayer He hears. He gathered all the priests of Baal, To call upon their god, They cried to him the whole day long, He answered not a word, But when Elijah called on God, Before the people there, The Lord sent fire from heaven above, Because He heard his prayer. CHORUS Elijah's God still lives today Oh blessed be His name And when His children to Him pray He answers still the same, Yes He controls the universe All things obey His word, And when by faith we call on Him, Our humble prayer He hears. Then to the top of Carmels mount, The holy prophet went And prayed unto the Lord again, That rain once more be seen, He poured his heart unto his God, Nor was his prayer in vain, The clouds in heaven again were seen, God sent a mighty rain. CHORUS Elijah's God still lives today Oh blessed be His name And when His children to Him pray He answers still the same, Yes He controls the universe All things obey His word, And when by faith we call on Him, Our humble prayer He hears.
