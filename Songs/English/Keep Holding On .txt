 Keep holding on, No matter what comes your way Soon the journey will be over Have faith in God, He will never let you down, Just keep on holding To those nail scarred hands. CHORUS They are strong and sure and you will never fear He'll hold you secure so let it keep you in cheer, Have faith in God, He'll never let you down, Just keep on holding to those nail scarred hands. Keep holding on, No matter what comes your way Soon the journey will be over; Knowing some day You will be so very glad, For you kept on holding To those nail scarred hands. CHORUS They are strong and sure and you will never fear He'll hold you secure so let it keep you in cheer, Have faith in God, He'll never let you down, Just keep on holding to those nail scarred hands.
