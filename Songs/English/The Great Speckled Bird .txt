 What a beautiful thought I am thinking, Concerning the great speckled bird, Remember her name is recorded, On the pages of God's Holy Word. All the other birds are flocking around her And she is not loved by this world But the great speckled bird in the Bible Represents the great Church of God. All the other birds it seems are against her They envy her glory and fame, They are against her because she is chosen And has never denied His dear name. She is spreading her wings for a journey That she's going to make by and by When the great trumpet sounds in the morning She will meet her dear Lord in the sky. In the presence of all the others With a song never heard before She will use and be gone in a moment Till the great tribulation is over. Oh I am glad I^ve learnt of a meeting, Oh I am glad that my name's in the Book For I want to be one never failing On the face of my Saviour to look. When He comes descending from heaven, On the clouds as He rides on His way, I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him On the wings of that great speckled bird. She will rise and be gone in a moment Till the great tribulation Is over.
