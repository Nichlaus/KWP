 Joys are flowing like a river Since the Comforter has come He abides with us for ever Makes the trusting heart His home CHORUS Blessed quietness, holy quietness What assurance in my soul On the stormy sea Jesus speaks to me And the billows cease too roll. Everything is turned to gladness All around this glorious guest Banished unbelief and sadness All is perfect peace and rest. CHORUS Blessed quietness, holy quietness What assurance in my soul On the stormy sea Jesus speaks to me And the billows cease too roll. Like the rain that falls from heaven Like the sunlight from the sky So the Holy Ghost He's given Falls upon us from on high. CHORUS Blessed quietness, holy quietness What assurance in my soul On the stormy sea Jesus speaks to me And the billows cease too roll. What a wonderful salvation Where we always see His face What a peaceful habitation What a quiet resting place. CHORUS Blessed quietness, holy quietness What assurance in my soul On the stormy sea Jesus speaks to me And the billows cease too roll.
