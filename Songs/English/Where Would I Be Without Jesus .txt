 When my burdens get heavy, I just kneel on my knees and pray, I ask the Lord to work them out, Not mine,but His own way Faith in His own sorrows relief Oh Without Jesus, where would I be? CHORUS Where would I be without Jesus, Where would I spend eternity? Lost in a world full of sorrows, Oh, without Jesus where would I be? In Chapter 14,of John verse two and three He said He is preparing a place for you and me, With Him on my side,that's all I'll ever need, For without Jesus where would I be? CHORUS Where would I be without Jesus, Where would I spend eternity? Lost in a world full of sorrows, Oh, without Jesus where would I be?
