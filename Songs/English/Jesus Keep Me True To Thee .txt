 When I was bound with chains of sin, And I was down cast with sorrows and shame; There was no-one, Oh not even one, To stand by me except Christ who died. CHORUS Oh loving Jesus keep me true to Thee And always ready to do Thy will To serve Thee till In the grave I'm laid, Hallelujah my tongue sings no more. Oh loving Jesus we thank you Lord, For Thy message to this our day, For if it were not for your amazing grace, We don't know, where we could be Dear Lord. CHORUS Oh loving Jesus keep me true to Thee And always ready to do Thy will To serve Thee till In the grave I'm laid, Hallelujah my tongue sings no more. My Lord, my whole life to Thee I yield, My Lord, my heart for Thee be swift My Lord my ways to Thee I resign And my lips confess it to the world. CHORUS Oh loving Jesus keep me true to Thee And always ready to do Thy will To serve Thee till In the grave I'm laid, Hallelujah my tongue sings no more. There was no way out, but for Thy death, To make me righteous before Thee oh Lord, To fulfil that wondrous plan of salvation, For me that blessed home to see. CHORUS Oh loving Jesus keep me true to Thee And always ready to do Thy will To serve Thee till In the grave I'm laid, Hallelujah my tongue sings no more.
