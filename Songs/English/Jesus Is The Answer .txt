 CHORUS Jesus is the answer for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus Is the way x 2 I know you have questions at the corner of your mind Traces of discouragement and peace you cannot find Reflection of the old past seem to face you everyday But this one thing I do know, Jesus is the way. CHORUS Jesus is the answer for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus Is the way x 2 I know you have mountains that you think you cannot climb I know your skies are dark you think the sun won't shine In case you don't know the Word of God is true And everything He promised He'll do it for you. CHORUS Jesus is the answer for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus Is the way x 2
