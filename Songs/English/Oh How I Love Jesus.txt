There is a name I love to hear,I love to sing its worth;It sounds like music in mine ear,The sweetest name on earth.CHORUSOh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Because He first loved me.It tells me of a Saviour's love,Who died to set me free;It tells me of His precious blood;The sinner's perfect plea.CHORUSOh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Because He first loved me.It tells me of what my Father hathIn store for every day,And though I tread a darksome path,Yields sunshine all the way.CHORUSOh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Oh, how I love Jesus,Because He first loved me.
