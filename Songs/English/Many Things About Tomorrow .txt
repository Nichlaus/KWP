 I don't know about tomorrow, I just live from day to day; I don't borrow from it's sunshine, For the sky may turn to grey; I don't worry for the future, For I know what Jesus said, And today I'll walk beside Him, For He knows what lies ahead. CHORUS Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know who holds tomorrow And I know who holds my hand. Every step is getting lighter, As the golden stairs I climb, Every burden is getting lighter Every sky is silver lined, Where the sun is ever shining, There's no tear to dim the eyes; At the ending of the rainbow Where the mountains touch the sky. CHORUS Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know who holds tomorrow And I know who holds my hand. I don't know about tomorrow It may bring me poverty; But the one who feeds the sparrows Is the one who stands by me; And the path that is my portion, May be through the flame of life, But His presence goes before me And I'm covered with His blood. CHORUS Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know who holds tomorrow And I know who holds my hand.
