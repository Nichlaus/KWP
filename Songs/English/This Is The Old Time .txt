 Some people say,this is old time religion It's just a thing of the past, But in these modern days that we are living It's just the thing that will last. Well, you may think I'm a little old fashioned Well, friends that's alright for me: But I am so glad that I am a Christian from sins I have been set free. CHORUS I know, I know, there is no doubt about it, He lives in my heart and am gonna shout it, I know, I know, my sins were all forgiven And am on my way to a place that's called heaven. Not long ago, in an old fashioned meeting I knelt there on my knees and I prayed, He lifted my burdens sins shackles fell from me His presence was present everywhere. Now that the load I carry is lighter, He's turned my grey skies to blue. My steps are higher I have this assurance That His sweet love will carry me through CHORUS I know, I know, there is no doubt about it, He lives in my heart and am gonna shout it, I know, I know, my sins were all forgiven And am on my way to a place that's called heaven. Come let us go to a land over yonder, Its prepared for the pure and the true It' a place where sickness and death can't enter I'm going my friend how about you? May be today or may be tomorrow He'll return In robes of pure white: Am packing up now getting all things together Who knows He may come tonight. CHORUS I know, I know, there is no doubt about it, He lives in my heart and am gonna shout it, I know, I know, my sins were all forgiven And am on my way to a place that's called heaven.
