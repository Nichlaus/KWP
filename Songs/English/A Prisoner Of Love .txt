 When I came to Jesus I settled it all I gave Him my life to control Neither fear nor persuasion,could draw me to Christ But His love has captured my soul. CHORUS I'm a prisoner of love I'm a slave to my Master I willingly toil through the heat and the cold; I seek no reward in this world below But the pay day will come, Oh Yes! When the pearly gates unfold.  He holds me secure with His love strong and true  I'm happy His servant to be  If bondaged to Jesus forever I'll stay  My soul doesn^t want to be free.  CHORUS  I'm a prisoner of love  I'm a slave to my Master  I willingly toil through the heat and the cold;  I seek no reward in this world below  But the pay day will come,  Oh Yes! When the pearly gates unfold.
