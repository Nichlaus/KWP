Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;His truth is marching on.CHORUSGlory!Glory,hallelujah!Glory!Glory,hallelujah!Glory!Glory,hallelujah!His truth is marching on.I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps;They have builded Him an alter in the evening dews and damps;He is sifting out the hearts of men before His Judgement seat;O be swift,my soul,to answer Him!be jubilant ,my feet!Our God is marching onCHORUSGlory!Glory,hallelujah!Glory!Glory,hallelujah!Glory!Glory,hallelujah!His truth is marching on.In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the see.With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;As He died to make men holy,let us die to make man free;While God is marching on.
