 When am tossed on life's sea,and the waves cover me And the dark clouds won't let the sun shine through Then a voice seems to say,child there will be a brighter day Don't allow the clouds to hide sweet heavens view. CHORUS (Cos you've got) one more valley One more hill (May be) one more trial,one more tear One more heavy life's load May be one more mile to go You can lay down your heavy load When you get home. Don't let Satan see your tears Learn to smile through your fears Hold your head up high and give the world smile You must be faithful all the way It will be worth it all some day For it's going to be over, after a while. CHORUS (Cos you've got) one more valley One more hill (May be) one more trial,one more tear One more heavy life's load May be one more mile to go You can lay down your heavy load When you get home.
