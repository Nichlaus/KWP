 On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, And cast a wishful eye, Toward Canaan's fair and happy land, Where my possessions lie. CHORUS I am bound for the promised land, I am bound for the promised land; O who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. O^er all those wide extended plains Shines one eternal day; There God the Son forever reigns, And scatters night away. CHORUS I am bound for the promised land, I am bound for the promised land; O who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. No chilling winds, nor poisonous breath, Can reach that healthful shore; Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, Are feared and felt no more. CHORUS I am bound for the promised land, I am bound for the promised land; O who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. When shall I reach that happy place, And be forever blest! When shall I see my Father's face, And in His bosom rest? CHORUS I am bound for the promised land, I am bound for the promised land; O who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land.
