 My name is in the Book of Life, Oh bless the Name of Jesus I rise above all doubt and strife And read my title clear. CHORUS I know, I know, I truly know My name is there I know, I know, I truly know My name is written there. With sinners lost once my name stood, Upon a painful record, But now it's cancelled by the Blood And written on His roll. CHORUS I know, I know, I truly know My name is there I know, I know, I truly know My name is written there. Yet inward trouble often cast A shadow o'er my title But now with full salvation blest Praise God its ever clear. CHORUS I know, I know, I truly know My name is there I know, I know, I truly know My name is written there. While others climb through worldly strife To carve a Name of Honour High up in heavens Book of Life My name is written there. CHORUS I know, I know, I truly know My name is there I know, I know, I truly know My name is written there.
