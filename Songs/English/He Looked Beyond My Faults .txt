 Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise For it was grace that bought my liberty I do not know just why He came to love me so He looked beyond my faults and saw my needs CHORUS I shall forever lift mine eyes to Calvary To view the cross where Jesus died for me How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul He looked beyond my faults and saw my needs It was Gods grace that brought me out of darkness Unto light where I can clearly see Ill shout it from the mountains and the valleys He looked beyond my fault and saw my needs CHORUS I shall forever lift mine eyes to Calvary To view the cross where Jesus died for me How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul He looked beyond my faults and saw my needs
