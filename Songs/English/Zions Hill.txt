There waits for me a glad tomorrow,Where gates of pearl swing open wide,And when I've passed this vale of sorrow,I'll camp upon the other side.CHORUSSome day beyond the reach of mortal ken,Some day, God only knows just where and when,The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still,And I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill.Some day I'll hear the angels singing,Beyond the shadows of the tomb;And all the bells of heaven ringing,While saints are singing, Home, sweet Home.CHORUSSome day beyond the reach of mortal ken,Some day, God only knows just where and when,The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still,And I shall go to dwell on Zion^s hill.Some day my labors will be ended,And all my wand'rings will be o'er,And all earth^s broken ties be mended,And I shall sigh and weep no more.CHORUSSome day beyond the reach of mortal ken,Some day, God only knows just where and when,The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still,And I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill.Some day the dark days will be rifted,And all the night of gloom be past;And all life's burdens will be lifted,The day of rest shall dawn at last.CHORUSSome day beyond the reach of mortal ken,Some day, God only knows just where and when,The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still,And I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill.
