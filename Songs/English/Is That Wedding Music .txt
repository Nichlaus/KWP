 The family is preparing for a wedding All have been invited to attend The bride is standing ready waiting for the signal When the Groom says, Rise my children come on in CHORUS Is that wedding music I hear The bride's adorned and ready to appear; There's heavenly preparations For the wedding celebration Is that wedding music that I hear Soon we'll rise to leave this land of sorrow For that ceremony in the air The Father then will lead us thru the Holy land of splendour Have you made your preparation to go there. CHORUS Is that wedding music I hear The bride's adorned and ready to appear; There's heavenly preparations For the wedding celebration Is that wedding music that I hear
