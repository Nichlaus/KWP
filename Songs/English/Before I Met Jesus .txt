 Before I met Jesus my life was empty and vain And nothing ahead could I see but sorrow and pain, But then at an altar one day I knelt. I found assurance that never has left, For Jesus was right for whatever was wrong in my life. CHORUS Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life Just give Him a chance and Jesus will prove That every promise He makes is true For Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life. Faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the Word, Just open your Bible and read it till God's voice you've heard, And then at an altar in repentance kneel You'll find assurance and you'll know it^s real For Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life. CHORUS Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life Just give Him a chance and Jesus will prove That every promise He makes is true For Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life.
