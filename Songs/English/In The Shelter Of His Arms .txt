 When my soul was disturbed with sorrow, When my heart was burdened with sin, Jesus opened His arms of mercy, And He tenderly took me in. CHORUS There Is peace in the time of trouble There is peace in the midst of the storm There is peace though the world be raging In the shelter of His arms. There are storms that we often encounter Do not fear they will do you no harm, In the storm you will find protection, In the shelter of His arms. CHORUS There Is peace in the time of trouble There is peace in the midst of the storm There is peace though the world be raging In the shelter of His arms. Though the world all around be raging And it's fears with many alarms But then Jesus said,He will keep you In the shelter of His arms. CHORUS There Is peace in the time of trouble There is peace in the midst of the storm There is peace though the world be raging In the shelter of His arms.
