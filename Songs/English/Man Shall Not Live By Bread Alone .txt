 Man shall not live by bread alone, But by every Word; That proceeds from the mouth of God, Hallelu, Hallelujah! I AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life, That's what Jesus said; No man comes to the Father but by Me, Hallelu, Hallelujah! Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness, And all these things shall be added unto you, Hallelu, Hallelujah! Knock and the Door will be opened unto you, Seek and ye shall find; Ask and it shall be given Unto you, Hallelu, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelu, Hallelujah!
