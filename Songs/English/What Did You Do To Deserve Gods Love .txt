 What did you do. . .to deserve God's love What can you do to be called His bride Nothing you did, and nothing you can do I'll trust in His grace and let Him have His way. When I look down at my life, I just can't see nothing good When I hear Him say these words, You are perfect, you have no sin What can I do, only to trust Him And let Him have His way. Now am not what I ought to be... Yet not what I used to be; But what made and brought the difference Is His work in my life I'll trust Him for my future For there is nothing I can do I will only let go and let Him have His way.
