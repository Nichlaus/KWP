 He leadeth me! O, blessed thought Oh, words with heavenly comfort fraught! Whatever I do, wherever I be, Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me! CHORUS He leadeth me! He leadeth me By His own hand He leadeth me! His faithful follower I would be For by His hand He leadeth me Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom, Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom, By waters still, over troubled sea, Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me! CHORUS He leadeth me! He leadeth me By His own hand He leadeth me! His faithful follower I would be For by His hand He leadeth me Lord, I would place my hands in Thine, Nor ever murmur nor repine; Content, whatever lot I see, Since 'tis my God that leadeth me. CHORUS He leadeth me! He leadeth me By His own hand He leadeth me! His faithful follower I would be For by His hand He leadeth me And when my task on earth is done, When, by Thy grace, the victory's won, Even death's cold wave I will not flee; Since Thou through Jordan leadest me. CHORUS He leadeth me! He leadeth me By His own hand He leadeth me! His faithful follower I would be For by His hand He leadeth me
