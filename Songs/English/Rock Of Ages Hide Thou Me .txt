 Some times I feel discouraged And think my lifes is vain Im tempted then to murmur and of my lot complain But when I think of Jesus and all Hes done for me The I cry, Oh rock of Ages Hide thou me CHORUS Oh rock of Ages Hide thou me No other refuge , have I but Thee When lifes dark vale I wander Far, far from thee Then I cry, O rock of Ages Hide Thou me Sometimes it seems I dare not go one step farther on And from my heart all courage has slipped away and gone But I remember Jesus and all His love for me Then I cry, O rock of ages Hide Thou me CHORUS Oh rock of Ages Hide thou me No other refuge , have I but Thee When lifes dark vale I wander Far, far from thee Then I cry, O rock of Ages Hide Thou me O what a Friend is Jesus Sure anchor of my soul So tender, true and gracious Im safe in his control My help in time of danger My strong defense is He O thou blessed Rock of Ages Hide Thou me CHORUS Oh rock of Ages Hide thou me No other refuge , have I but Thee When lifes dark vale I wander Far, far from thee Then I cry, O rock of Ages Hide Thou me
