 I have found there is someone to follow For He died and He cares for my soul, And His promises so sure and so true For He died and cares for me. CHORUS Has your soul been saved,or you say you don't care Whether you care or don't care sure you need someone To take away your sins and no-one else can do Only Jesus who died and cares for you. Are you going ahead without His joy? Are you going ahead,ahead without His peace? For me I know,its the last thing in my mind (x2) Life may be dull and dark every morning Every noon, evening, any time, But you need not stay that way For one died and cares for you. CHORUS Has your soul been saved,or you say you don't care Whether you care or don't care sure you need someone To take away your sins and no-one else can do Only Jesus who died and cares for you. Are you going ahead without His joy? Are you going ahead,ahead without His peace? For me I know,its the last thing in my mind (x2) It is true and I know that one day, Something marvellous, wonderful, When we see Him on whom we believe Coming down with clouds for us. CHORUS Has your soul been saved,or you say you don't care Whether you care or don't care sure you need someone To take away your sins and no-one else can do Only Jesus who died and cares for you. Are you going ahead without His joy? Are you going ahead,ahead without His peace? For me I know,its the last thing in my mind (x2)
