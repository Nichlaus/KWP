 On Calvary's hill of sorrow Where sin's demands were paid, And rays of hope for tomorrow Across our path were laid. CHORUS I see a crimson stream of blood. It flows from Calvary, Its waves which reach the throne of God, Are sweeping over me. Today no condemnation Abides to turn away My soul from His salvation, He's in my heart to stay. CHORUS I see a crimson stream of blood. It flows from Calvary, Its waves which reach the throne of God, Are sweeping over me. When gloom and sadness whisper You've sinned, no use to pray; I look away to Jesus And He tells me to say: CHORUS I see a crimson stream of blood. It flows from Calvary, Its waves which reach the throne of God, Are sweeping over me. And when we reach the portal Where life forever reigns, The ransomed hosts grand final Will be this glad refrain. CHORUS I see a crimson stream of blood. It flows from Calvary, Its waves which reach the throne of God, Are sweeping over me.
