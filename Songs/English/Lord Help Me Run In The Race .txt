 CHORUS Lord help me run in the race, Help me not bring you disgrace, But let me rise on wings of faith, Until the day I'll see your face. Sometimes the way down here gets rough, When I look at Satan's plans, It's then I rise on wings of faith, For in God's word I am safe. CHORUS Lord help me run in the race, Help me not bring you disgrace, But let me rise on wings of faith, Until the day I'll see your face. Now we can see the end is near, The coming of the Lord is nigh, Oh sinner where will you stand When the time down here will end? CHORUS Lord help me run in the race, Help me not bring you disgrace, But let me rise on wings of faith, Until the day I'll see your face.
