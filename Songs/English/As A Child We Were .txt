 As a child we were poor,and tossed in the blues I wept bitter tear drops alone in my room, The family circle was broken by troubles and sin But Jesus held on to my hand. CHORUS Jesus held on to my hand Giving me comfort that only He can More than a father, brother or friend But Jesus, held on to my hand. At the old saints revival they were making the plea, I joined them in singing, He is all that I need He is all that I need I sat at the altar after three weeks to stand But Jesus held on to my hand. CHORUS Jesus held on to my hand Giving me comfort that only He can More than a father, brother or friend But Jesus, held on to my hand.
