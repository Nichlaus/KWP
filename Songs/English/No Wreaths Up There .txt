 If I could count the tears that have fallen, It would seem like an ocean to me, And if my heart were a window you could look through, All the pain and the scars you would see. CHORUS But tears will never stain the streets of that city, No wreaths up there, on my mansion door Tear drops unwelcome beyond the gates of glory Cos the heart will never break any more. I have never met one man without sorrow, Never looked into eyes with no pain, But there's a land where grief Lord is a stranger, And joy is the only song they sing. CHORUS But tears will never stain the streets of that city, No wreaths up there, on my mansion door Tear drops unwelcome beyond the gates of glory Cos the heart will never break any more.
