 I'll see all my friends in Hallelujah Square What a wonderful time we will all have up there We'll sing and praise Jesus,His glory to share, And you'll not see one cripple in Hallelujah Square. I saw a blind man, tapping along, Loosing his way as he passed through the Throng, Tears filled my eyes,I said friend you can't see, With a smile on his face he replied to me... I'll see all my friends in Hallelujah Square, What a wonderful time we will al have up there We'll sing and praise Jesus His glory to share, And you'll not see one blind man in Hallelujah Square! Now I saw an old man gasping for breath, Soon he'd be gone as his eyes closed in death, He looked at me, said, boy don't look so blue I am going up to heaven,now how about you? I'll see all my friends in Hallelujah Square What a wonderful time we will all have up there, We'll sing and praise Jesus His glory to share, And you'll not see one old man in Hallelujah Square!.
