 Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling. Who will go and work for Me today? Who will bring to Me the lost and dying? Who will point them to the narrow way? CHORUS Speak, my Lord, speak my Lord, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I will answer, Lord, send me. When the coal of fire touched the prophet, Making him as pure as pure can be. When the voice of God, said Who'll go for us? Then he answered,Here I am , send me. CHORUS Speak, my Lord, speak my Lord, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I will answer, Lord, send me. Millions now in sin and shame are dying; Listen to their sad and bitter cry; Hasten, brother, hasten to the rescue; Quickly answer, Master, here am I. CHORUS Speak, my Lord, speak my Lord, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord, Speak, and I will answer, Lord, send me. Soon the time for reaping will be over; Soon we'll gather for the harvest home; May the Lord of harvest smile upon us, May we hear His blessed, Child, well done.
