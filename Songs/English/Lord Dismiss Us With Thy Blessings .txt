 Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing, Fill our hearts with joy and peace; Let us each, Thy love possessing, Triumph in redeeming grace: Oh, refresh us! Travelling through this wilderness. Thanks we give, and adoration, For Thy Gospel's joyful sound; May the fruits of Thy salvation In our hearts and lives abound: May Thy presence With us ever more be found! So, whenever the signal^s given Us from earth to call away, Borne on angels' wings to heaven, Glad the summons to obey, May we ever Reign with Christ in endless day!
