 I've cast my heavy burdens down, On canaans happy shore I'm living where the healing waters flow I will wander in the wilderness of sin and doubt no more, I'm living where the healing waters flow.  CHORUS Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow, Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow With Israel^s trusting children I'm rejoicing on the way I'm living where the healing waters flow, The cloudy fiery pillar is my guiding light today I'm living where the healing waters flow. CHORUS Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow, Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow My hung'ring soul is satisfied With manna from above, I'm living where the healing waters flow, No more I thirst, the rock I've found That fount of endless love I'm living where the healing waters flow. CHORUS Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow, Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow I'm singing hallelujah, Safely anchored in my soul, I'm living where the healing waters flow, I am resting on His promises, The blood has made me whole, I'm living where the healing waters flow. CHORUS Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow, Living on the shore, I'm living on the shore, I'm living where the healing waters flow
