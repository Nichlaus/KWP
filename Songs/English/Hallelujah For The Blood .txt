 Hallelujah for the blood that redeems us, Hallelujah! I Will sing it on and on, Hallelujah for the blood of that precious Son of God, Hallelujah for ever more. CHORUS He is Lord He is Lord! He Is risen from the dead And He is Lord! Every knee shall bow, Every tongue confess, That Jesus Christ He's Lord!
