 Holy words Long Preserved, For a Walk in this world, They resound with God's own heart, Oh let the Word of God Impact; Word of God ever true, Changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts Oh' let the Word of God impact X2 Words of Life Words of Hope Give us strength help us cope In this world where we roam The Word of God will guide us home. Holy words of our Faith Handed down to this age Came to us through sacrifice Oh heed the faithful words of Christ.
