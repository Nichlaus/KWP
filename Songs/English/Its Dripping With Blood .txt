 The first one to die for this Holy Ghost plan, Was John the Baptist, but he died like a man; Then cam the Lord Jesus, they crucified Him, He taught that the Spirit would save men from sin. CHORUS It's dripping with blood, yes, it's dripping with blood. This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. The blood of disciples who died for the Truth, This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. There was Peter and Paul, and John the divine, They gave up their lives so this Gospel could shine; They mingled their blood, like the prophets of old, So the true Word of God could honest be told. CHORUS It's dripping with blood, yes, it's dripping with blood. This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. The blood of disciples who died for the Truth, This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. Then they stoned Stephen, he preached against sin, He made them so angry, they dashed his head in; But he died in the Spirit, and gave up the ghost, And went to join others, in that life-giving host. CHORUS It's dripping with blood, yes, it's dripping with blood. This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. The blood of disciples who died for the Truth, This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. There's souls under the altar, crying, How Long? For the Lord to punish those who've done wrong; But there's going to be more who'll give their life's blood For this Holy Ghost Gospel and its crimson flood. CHORUS It's dripping with blood, yes, it's dripping with blood. This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood. The blood of disciples who died for the Truth, This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood.
