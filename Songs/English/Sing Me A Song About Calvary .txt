 CHORUS Sing me a song about Calvary, Show me Its' suffering in love Tell it till each part of my soul sublimes Thank God for the old rugged Cross. There's an empty tomb in Jerusalem today, That plainly to us testifies, That He who slept there no longer is dead But liveth and reigneth on high. And just as sure as He came below To suffer and die for my sins; Just as sure what I feel in my heart; Makes me know He's soon coming again. CHORUS Sing me a song about Calvary, Show me Its' suffering in love Tell it till each part of my soul sublimes Thank God for the old rugged Cross. They say soon each mountain and each lofty place, Will be brought down by God's will Yet in my heart for ever will stand, The vision of Golgotha hill. Cos that's where Jesus my Saviour and Lord Gladly the sacrifice made So when I repented and came to His Throne There I found sins debt already was paid. CHORUS Sing me a song about Calvary, Show me Its' suffering in love Tell it till each part of my soul sublimes Thank God for the old rugged Cross.
