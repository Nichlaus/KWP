 Once I served the Lord only with my lips And I put all my trust in my church membership And in my soul I was lost,earnestly I prayed Till I knew without a doubt I'm Saved CHORUS Without a doubt I'm saved I have been born again Washed In calvary's flow pure and white within. Though I once was lost and in sins chains enslaved But now I know without a doubt I'm saved. There is a deep settled peace in my happy soul My life has an aim heaven is my goal And the world's gathering storms Cannot make me afraid And now I know without a doubt I'm saved. CHORUS Without a doubt I'm saved I have been born again Washed In calvary's flow pure and white within. Though I once was lost and in sins chains enslaved But now I know without a doubt I'm saved.
