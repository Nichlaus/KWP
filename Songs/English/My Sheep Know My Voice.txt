My sheep know My voice,And the path that I take,They follow wherever I go;My sheep know My voiceAnd come at My call,But a stranger^s voice do they not know.CHORUSMY sheep know My voiceAnd day by day,They abide in the fold,And go not astray,They love me becauseI have them My choice,And they follow My call,For My sheep know My voice.My sheep know My voice,And the pastures of green,Where I lead them so often to feed;My sheep know My voice,And the cool sparkling stream,Where beside its still waters I lead.CHORUSMY sheep know My voiceAnd day by day,They abide in the fold,And go not astray,They love me becauseI have them My choice,And they follow My call,For My sheep know My voice.My sheep know My voice,And the valley of death,Thru which I shall lead them some day;But no danger nor harmCan touch one of themFor I will be with them always.CHORUSMY sheep know My voiceAnd day by day,They abide in the fold,And go not astray,They love me becauseI have them My choice,And they follow My call,For My sheep know My voice.
