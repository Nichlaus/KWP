 Some glad morning We shall see Jesus in the air, Coming after you and me, Joy is ours to share; What rejoicing there will be When the saints shall rise, Headed for that jubilee, Yonder in the skies. CHORUS Oh, what singing, Oh, what shouting, On that happy morning When we shall rise; Oh what glory, Hallelujah! When we meet our blessed Saviour In the skies. Seems that I almost see All the sainted dead, Rising for that jubilee, That is just ahead; In the twinkling of an eye, Changed with them to be, All the living saints to fly To that jubilee. CHORUS Oh, what singing, Oh, what shouting, On that happy morning When we shall rise; Oh what glory, Hallelujah! When we meet our blessed Saviour In the skies. When with all the heavenly host We begin to sing, Singing in the Holy Ghost, How the heavens will ring. Millions there will join the song, With them we shall be; Praising Christ through ages long, Heaven's jubilee. CHORUS Oh, what singing, Oh, what shouting, On that happy morning When we shall rise; Oh what glory, Hallelujah! When we meet our blessed Saviour In the skies.
