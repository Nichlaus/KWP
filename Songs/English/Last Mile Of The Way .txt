 If I walk in the pathway of duty, If I work till the close of the day, I shall see the great King in His beauty, When I've gone the last mile of the way. CHORUS When I've gone the last mile of the way, I will rest at the close of the day, And I know there are joys that await me, When I've gone the last mile of the way. Here the dearest of ties we must sever, Tears of sorrows are seen every day, But no sickness, no sighing for ever, When I've gone the last mile of the way. CHORUS When I've gone the last mile of the way, I will rest at the close of the day, And I know there are joys that await me, When I've gone the last mile of the way. And if here I have earnestly striven, And have tried all His will to obey, Twill enhance all the rapture of heaven, When I've gone the last mile of the way. CHORUS When I've gone the last mile of the way, I will rest at the close of the day, And I know there are joys that await me, When I've gone the last mile of the way.
