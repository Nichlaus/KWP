Teach me, Lord, to wait down on my knees,Till in Your own good time You answer my pleas;Teach me not to rely on what others do,But to wait in prayer for an answer from You.CHORUSThey that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strengthThey shall mount up with wings as an eagle,They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and faint;Teach me Lord, teach me Lord, to wait.Teach me Lord, to wait while hearts are aflame,Help me humble my pride and call on Your Name;Keep my faith renewed, keep my eyes on Thee;Help me be on this earth what You want me to be.CHORUSThey that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strengthThey shall mount up with wings as an eagle,They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and faint;Teach me Lord, teach me Lord, to wait.
