 Go,ahead, drive the nails in my hand, Laugh at me, where you stand, Go ahead,and say it isn't me, The day will come,when you will see. CHORUS Cause I'll rise again, Ain't no power on earth can tie me down; Yes, I'll rise again, Death can't keep me in the ground. Go ahead, and mock my name, My love for you is still the same; Go ahead, and bury me, But very soon, I will be free. CHORUS Cause I'll rise again, Ain't no power on earth can tie me down; Yes, I'll rise again, Death can't keep me in the ground. Go ahead, and say I'm dead and gone, But you will see that you were wrong; Go ahead, try to hide the Son, But all will see, that I'm the One. CHORUS Cause I'll rise again, Ain't no power on earth can tie me down; Yes, I'll rise again, Death can't keep me in the ground.
