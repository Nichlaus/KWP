 Living water flowing from above Through the spirit of never ending love Truly I'm the first to declare my longing thirst For the water that comes from above. Give me water from the well that never runs dry Give me water from the well that gives me hope when I die Give me water from the well that never runs dry and I will thirst no more. Living water leads me to my goal Now refreshing and cleansing to my soul Truly I'm alive and I know I can't survive Without it,the pure waters flow.
