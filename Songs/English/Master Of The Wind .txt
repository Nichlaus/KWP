 CHORUS I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain He can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind My boat of life sails on a troubled sea Ever theres a wind in my sail But I have a friend who watches over me When the breeze turns into a gale CHORUS I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain He can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind Sometime I soar like an eagle in the sky to the peak Among the peaks my soul can be found An unexpected storm may drive me from the heights It may bring me low but it will never bring me down CHORUS I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain He can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind
