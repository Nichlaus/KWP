When the day is dark before you,And the clouds are hanging low, There isOne who watches o'er you,Everywhere that you may go.CHORUSJesus is the one, yes, He's the only one,Let Him have His way until the day is done;When He speaks, you know the clouds will have to go,Just because He loves you so.O if you are sad and lonely,Life is but an empty tomb,Breathe a prayer to Jesus only,He will drive away the gloom.CHORUSJesus is the one, yes, He's the only one,Let Him have His way until the day is done;When He speaks, you know the clouds will have to go,Just because He loves you so.When you come to cross the river,He will be your Friend and guide;You can live with Him forever,Over on the other side.CHORUSJesus is the one, yes, He's the only one,Let Him have His way until the day is done;When He speaks, you know the clouds will have to go,Just because He loves you so.
