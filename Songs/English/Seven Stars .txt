 Seven stars in the hand of Jesus, Were the messengers to each age, Now the seventh star has come and gone, And here is what he's seen. CHORUS He's seen the Bride come walking, The gowns were white as snow, In their hearts there was the Master^s love, And their faces there was a glow. By faith we'll be in that number, The one's He chose for His Bride, Though we fail each day in this world below, Some day we'll be by His side. CHORUS He's seen the Bride come walking, The gowns were white as snow, In their hearts there was the Master's love, And their faces there was a glow.
