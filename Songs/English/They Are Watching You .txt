 Though the world, has forsaken God Treads a diferent path,lives a different way, I walk the road, that the Saviour trod. That all may know,I live under Jesus' way. CHORUS They are watching you Marking all you do Hearing the things you say Let them see the Saviour as He shines in you Let His power control you every day. Men will look, at the life I lead See the things I take,and the things I love, They judge my Lord by my every deed Lord,set my affection on things above. CHORUS They are watching you Marking all you do Hearing the things you say Let them see the Saviour as He shines in you Let His power control you every day. Here on earth, people walk in the night With no light to guide, they are dead in sin I know the Lord, who can give them light I live yet not I, but Christ within. CHORUS They are watching you Marking all you do Hearing the things you say Let them see the Saviour as He shines in you Let His power control you every day.
