 I was alone and drifting on the lonely sea of sin, Nothing but darkness,no sunshine within, I lifted up my eyes to the Lord in the sky, Glory to God He remembered me. CHORUS Jesus remembered me,oh glory, glory, And so He set me free, Once I was blind but now I can see Glory to God He remembered me. As He taught His disciples by the sea of Galilee He said He'd remember a mortal like me I asked for His forgiveness down on my knees Glory to God He remembered me. CHORUS Jesus remembered me,oh glory, glory, And so He set me free, Once I was blind but now I can see Glory to God He remembered me. Now the dawn is breaking I am happy and free No more sorrows and troubles for me I'm going home in glory My Saviour to see Glory to God He remembered me. CHORUS Jesus remembered me,oh glory, glory, And so He set me free, Once I was blind but now I can see Glory to God He remembered me.
