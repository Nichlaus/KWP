 CHORUS God knows my heart Is pure And I strive to do some good Though temptations are so hard to overcome I'll rejoice on that day when I'll hear my Saviour say Lay your burdens down my child,welcome home! I'm so troubled and so weary that I don't know what to do But the Lord said that Hed see me through All the road that I have travelled has been long and so dark But the Lord knows what is in my heart. CHORUS God knows my heart Is pure And I strive to do some good Though temptations are so hard to overcome I'll rejoice on that day when I'll hear my Saviour say Lay your burdens down my child,welcome home! Oh, Satan has a power to tempt a sinner man Till he's caught up in a snare he can't undo If you hear the gentle whisper of the Master's voice above I know that the Lord will see you through. CHORUS God knows my heart Is pure And I strive to do some good Though temptations are so hard to overcome I'll rejoice on that day when I'll hear my Saviour say Lay your burdens down my child,welcome home!
