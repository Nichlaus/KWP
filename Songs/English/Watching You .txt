 All along on the road to the soul's true abode, There's an Eye watching you; Every step that you take, this great Eye is awake, There's an Eye watching you. CHORUS Watching you, watching you, Every day mind the course you pursue; Watching you, watching you, There's an all-seeing Eye watching you. As you make life^s great flight, keep the pathway of right, There's an Eye watching you; God will warn not to go in the path of the foe, There's an Eye watching you. CHORUS Watching you, watching you, Every day mind the course you pursue; Watching you, watching you, There's an all-seeing Eye watching you. Fix your mind on the goal, that sweet home of the soul, There's an Eye watching you; Never turn from the way to the kingdom of day, There's an Eye watching you. CHORUS Watching you, watching you, Every day mind the course you pursue; Watching you, watching you, There's an all-seeing Eye watching you.
