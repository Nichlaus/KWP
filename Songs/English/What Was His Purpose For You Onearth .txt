 The Lord is coming just for you Why cant you be ready The life spend He offers you free Then have you thought the cost? CHORUS What was His purpose for you on earth? Hey did He die for you (and me) The moment are passing but stop to think What have you done with God Your life is meant for His life alone Why give yourself to the world? He sighed He paid by bearing your sins Just serve Him alone CHORUS What was His purpose for you on earth? Hey did He die for you (and me) The moment are passing but stop to think What have you done with God Just give me courage in hardest times Determination for challenging tasks Sufficient grace is what I need To overcome always CHORUS What was His purpose for you on earth? Hey did He die for you (and me) The moment are passing but stop to think What have you done with God Dont harden your soul in sins deceit Provocation should not be your guide For Christ the Lord went rolling on earth And was the image of God CHORUS What was His purpose for you on earth? Hey did He die for you (and me) The moment are passing but stop to think What have you done with God
