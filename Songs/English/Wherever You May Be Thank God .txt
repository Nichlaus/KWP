 CHORUS Thank God for all the flowers and each tree Thank God for all the mountains and the seas Thank God for giving life to you and me Wherever you may be,thank God. Be forgiving to the wayward Like the Master told us to When He said forgive them Father For they know not what they do They'd change their ways of living If they could but understand So remember they're your brothers They need a helping hand. CHORUS Thank God for all the flowers and each tree Thank God for all the mountains and the seas Thank God for giving life to you and me Wherever you may be,thank God. Now the road is straight and narrow That the saints have travelled on It's with all the tribulations Of the martyrs that have gone If we pray to God for the victory And for showing us the way Then give thanks for all the blessings Get down on your knees and pray. CHORUS Thank God for all the flowers and each tree Thank God for all the mountains and the seas Thank God for giving life to you and me Wherever you may be,thank God.
