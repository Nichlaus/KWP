Down at the cross where my saviour died,Down where for cleansing from sin I cried;There to my heart was the blood applied;Glory to His name!CHORUSGlory to His name!Glory to His name!There to my heart was the blood applied;Glory to His name!I am so wondrously saved from sin,Jesus so sweetly abides within,There at the cross He took me in;Glory to His name!CHORUSGlory to His name!Glory to His name!There to my heart was the blood applied;Glory to His name!Oh precious fountain that saves from sin!I am so glad I have entered in;There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;Glory to His name!CHORUSGlory to His name!Glory to His name!There to my heart was the blood applied;Glory to His name!Come to the fountain so rich and so sweet;Cast thy poor soul at The saviour's feet;Plunge in today,and be made complete!Glory to His name!CHORUSGlory to His name!Glory to His name!There to my heart was the blood applied;Glory to His name!
