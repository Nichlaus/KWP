By grace I will Thy mercy now receive Thy love my heart has won On Thee Oh Christ I will, I will believe And trust in Thee alone. CHORUS I will,l will, I will God helping me I will Oh Lord be Thine Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me I will be wholly Thine. Thou knowest Lord,how very weak I am And how I fear to stray, For strength to serve I look to Thee alone, The strength Thou must supply. CHORUS I will,l will, I will God helping me I will Oh Lord be Thine Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me I will be wholly Thine. And now Oh Lord give all with us to stay Thy grace to join our song, And from the heart to gladly with us stay I will to Christ belong. CHORUS I will,l will, I will God helping me I will Oh Lord be Thine Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me I will be wholly Thine. To all who came when Thou was here below, And said, Oh Lord will Thou? To them I will, was ever your reply We rest upon it now. CHORUS I will,l will, I will God helping me I will Oh Lord be Thine Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me I will be wholly Thine.
