 Pass me not, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art smiling, Do not pass me by. CHORUS Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Let me at Thy throne of mercy Find a sweet relief; Kneeling there in deep contrition, Help my unbelief. CHORUS Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded, broken spirit, Save me by Thy grace. CHORUS Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Thou the Spring of all my comfort, More than life to me. Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Whom in heaven but Thee? CHORUS Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.
