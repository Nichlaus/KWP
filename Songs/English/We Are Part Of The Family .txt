 We are part of the family,that's been born again, Part of the family,whose love knows no end For Jesus has saved us and made us His own, Now we're part of the family,that's on its way home. CHORUS And sometimes we laugh together, Sometimes we cry; Sometimes we share together what is inside, Sometimes we dream together,of how It will be When we all get to heaven,God's peaceful shore. When a brother in sorrow,we all feel his grief, When he goes through the valley,we all feel relieved Together in sunshine,together in rain, Together in victory,through His blood. CHORUS And sometimes we laugh together, Sometimes we cry; Sometimes we share together what is inside, Sometimes we dream together,of how It will be When we all get to heaven,God's peaceful shore. And though some go before us,we'll all meet again, Just inside the city,as we enter in, There will be no more parting,with Jesus we'll be, Together, forever,God shall never leave. CHORUS And sometimes we laugh together, Sometimes we cry; Sometimes we share together what is inside, Sometimes we dream together,of how It will be When we all get to heaven,God's peaceful shore.
