 We need our spirit filled preachers, to teach us right from wrong, We need our old fashioned seekers, who will pray all night long, We need a good gospel singing, to help us go another mile, The church and will triumph on, and go home in a little while. CHORUS It will be worth it after all child, it will be worth it after all, After all of these trials, well hear Jesus call, It will be worth it after all church, it will be worth it after all, After all of these climbing, it will be worth it after all. When youre down in the valley, pray is all I can do, That the Lord sends deliverance, and strengthens you, Now if youre up on the mountain, and see me struggling along, Lift my name up to Jesus, lets help each other make it home. CHORUS It will be worth it after all child, it will be worth it after all, After all of these trials, well hear Jesus call, It will be worth it after all child, it will be worth it after all, After all of these climbing, it will be worth it after all.
