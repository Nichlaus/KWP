 For many long years, I^ve travelled life^s road I'm weary and tired of carrying life's load, So often times am tempted by Satan to bow, But I'm journeying home,to turn back no! CHORUS Almost home,I'm almost home, I know my race Is almost run, Though troubles and sorrows have already come But I can't turn back now I am too near home When I stand at the river,that homeland I see, With its beautiful mansion He has prepared for me, Just a few days to linger,then I'll go across And I know what awaits me will be worth it all! CHORUS Almost home,I'm almost home, I know my race Is almost run, Though troubles and sorrows have already come But I can't turn back now I am too near home
