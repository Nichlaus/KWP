 I am a stranger here,within a foreign land, My home is far away upon the golden strand Ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea I am here on business for my King. CHORUS This Is the message that I bring, A message angels for would sing, Oh be ye reconciled, thus saith my Lord and King Be ye reconciled to God. This is the King's command,that all men everywhere Repent and turn away from sin seductive snare That all who will obey with Him shall reign on high And that's my business for my King. CHORUS This Is the message that I bring, A message angels for would sing, Oh be ye reconciled, thus saith my Lord and King Be ye reconciled to God. My home is bright and fair than Sharon's rosy plains Eternal life and joy throughout it's vast domain, My sovereign bids me tell how mortals there may dwell And that's my business for my King. CHORUS This Is the message that I bring, A message angels for would sing, Oh be ye reconciled, thus saith my Lord and King Be ye reconciled to God.
