 I've never travelled far around the world, I've never seen so many things And thrills afar But I have taken a journey of journeys for me; Up calvary's mountain There my saviour to see. CHORUS I've been to calvary, I can say I've seen the Lord I've been to calvary, Through the witness of His Word, Each day at calvary, What a thrill of joy divine Just to know, that the Saviour Is mine. I walked up calvary^s road, Where Jesus trod; I saw Him hanging there, The Son of God, With tear strained eyes I knelt and prayed 'Jesus save my soul' Oh praise the Lord, I'm glad I've been to calvary. CHORUS I've been to calvary, I can say I've seen the Lord I've been to calvary, Through the witness of His Word, Each day at calvary, What a thrill of joy divine Just to know, that the Saviour Is mine.
