 I've just come into a valley One like I've never been before I keep searching for a way out Seems like padlocks are on the door Oh! There must be another sunrise Another sunset that I see God will make this trial a blessing Thats the love He has for me God will make this trial a blessing Though it send me to my knees Though my tears flow like a river Yet in him theres sweet relieve There is no need to get discourged Theres no need to talk defeat God will make this trial a blessing And the whole wide world will see I was not the first one to come to this place You see every son of God This test he must face It is here that God will mould you And make you what you ought to be God will make this trial a blessing Just be patient you will see Now Im standing on a mountain Looking back, I can see When I was in that lowest valley His strong hand was leading me Oh! Its good so see the sunrise And to taste sweet victory God has made my trial a blessing Oh, the grace He gives to me
