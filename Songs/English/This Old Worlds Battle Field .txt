 This old worlds battlefield Where we must fight each day To overcome the evil one And send him on his way My commander is almighty God Theres none greater near or far I may lose battle now and then But I've already won the war CHORUS You can have this confidence That helps to see me through If youll just give Him residence Let Him live inside you He hasnt promised that its easy But salvations worth the scars I may lose a battle now and then But I've already won the war When youre afraid and all alone And think that no one cares And the daily task of getting by Has caused you to despair Just take Gods word in your heart And know His promise stands I may loose a battle now and then But the victorys in Gods hands CHORUS You can have this confidence That helps to see me through If youll just give Him residence Let Him live inside you He hasnt promised that its easy But salvations worth the scars I may lose a battle now and then But I've already won the war
