 Sun of my soul,Thou Saviour dear, It is not night if Thou be near; Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise To hide Thee from Thy servants eyes! When the soft dews of gentle sleep My wearied eyelids gently steep, Be my last thought, how sweet to rest For ever on my Saviour's Breast! Abide with me from morn till eve, For without Thee I cannot live; Abide with me when night is nigh, For without Thee I dare not die. If some poor wandering child of Thine Have spurned today the voice divine, Now, Lord, the gracious work begin; Let him no more lie down in sin. Watch by the sick; enrich the poor With blessings from Thy boundless store: Be every mourner's sleep tonight Like infant's slumbers, pure and light. Come near and bless us when we wake, Ere through the world our way we take; Till, in the ocean of Thy love, We lose ourselves in heaven above.
