 Though shadows deepen,and my heart bleeds, I will not question the way He leads, This side of heaven,we know in part, I will not question a broken heart CHORUS We'll talk it over In the by and by We'll talk it over my Lord and I I'll ask the reason He'll tell me why When we talk it over in the by and by. I'll trust His leading, He'll never fail, Through darkest shadows or misty rays Obey His teachings and faithful be, For only one step ahead I see. CHORUS We'll talk it over In the by and by We'll talk it over my Lord and I I'll ask the reason He'll tell me why When we talk it over in the by and by. I'll hide my heartaches, behind a smile And wait for reason till after a while Although He tries me,I know I'll find That all my burdens are silvery lined. CHORUS We'll talk it over In the by and by We'll talk it over my Lord and I I'll ask the reason He'll tell me why When we talk it over in the by and by.
