The circuit-rider preacher went riding through the land.With a rifle on his shoulder and a Bible in his hand;He told the prairie people of a blessed Promised land,As he went riding,singing alongCHORUSLeaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arm;Leaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.He preached the coming judgement of fire and brimstone;And a glorious endless Heaven of the justified alone.As he rode across the mountains you could hear him sing this song,As went riding on.CHORUSLeaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arm;Leaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.There is power,power,wonder-working power.In the blood of the Lamb;There is power,power,wonder-working power.In the precious blood of the Lamb.CHORUSLeaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arm;Leaning,leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.His rifle's old and rusty,and it's hanging on the wall;His Bible's worn and dusty,and it's seldom touched touched at all;But his Message from this Bible will meet us at Judgement Day,For God's Truth is keeps marching on.CHORUSGlory! glory, hallelujah!Glory! glory,hallelujah!Glory! glory, hallelujah!His Truth is marching on.
