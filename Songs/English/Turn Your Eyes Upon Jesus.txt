O soul, are you weary and troubled?No light in the darkness you see?There's light for a look at the Saviour,And life more abundant and free!CHORUSTurn your eyes upon Jesus,Look full in His wonderful face;And the things of earth will grow strangely dimIn the light of His glory and grace.Through death into life everlastingHe passed, and we follow Him there;Over us sin no more hath dominion,For more than conqu^rors we are!CHORUSTurn your eyes upon Jesus,Look full in His wonderful face;And the things of earth will grow strangely dimIn the light of His glory and grace.His Word shall not fail you,He promised; Believe Him, and all will be well;Then go to a world that is dying,His perfect salvation to tell!CHORUSTurn your eyes upon Jesus,Look full in His wonderful face;And the things of earth will grow strangely dimIn the light of His glory and grace.
