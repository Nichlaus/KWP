What a fellowship, what a joy divine,Leaning on the everlasting arms;What a blessedness, what a piece is mine,Leaning on the everlasting arms.CHORUSLeaning, leaning,Safe and secure from all alarms;Leaning, leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,Leaning on the everlasting arms;Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,Leaning on the everlasting arms.CHORUSLeaning, leaning,Safe and secure from all alarms;Leaning, leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.What have I to dread, what have I fear,Leaning on the everlasting arms;I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,Leaning on the everlasting arms.CHORUSLeaning, leaning,Safe and secure from all alarms;Leaning, leaning,Leaning on the everlasting arms.
