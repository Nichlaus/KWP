 These hands are made of clay I know These hands are made from dust But my soul shall live for ever more If in my God I trust. CHORUS This body has grown so tired Oh Lord With these old and work won hands, But when I die,I know my soul shall rest Up there in God's great hands. Though these two feet,are made from earth. And to earth they must return, But when my soul shall reach its goal, Is now my great concern. CHORUS This body has grown so tired Oh Lord With these old and work won hands, But when I die,I know my soul shall rest Up there in God's great hands.
