Noah had drifted,On the floods many days,He searched for landIn various ways;Troubles he had some,But not from above,God gave him His signOn the wings of a dove.CHORUSOn the wings of a snow-white dove,God sends down His pure, sweet love,A sign from above,On the wings of a dove.Jesus, our SaviourCame to earth one day;He was born in a stable,In a manger of hay;Though here rejected,But not from above,God gave us His signOn the wings of a dove.CHORUSOn the wings of a snow-white dove,God sends down His pure, sweet love,A sign from above,On the wings of a dove.Though I have sufferedIn a many a way,I cried for healingBoth night and day;Faith wasn't forgottenBy the Father above,He gave me His signOn the wings of a dove.CHORUSOn the wings of a snow-white dove,God sends down His pure, sweet love,A sign from above,On the wings of a dove.
