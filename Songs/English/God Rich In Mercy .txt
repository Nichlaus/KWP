 This world was lost and so undone, Just look at what sin has done, Believing the lie that Satan told to Eve that day, Throwing this world in total despair, In east of Eden no longer could dwell Now they can see driven from God what sin has done. CHORUS God rich in mercy, God rich in mercy, Sent us His Son, we were undone, God rich In mercy; God rich In grace,God rich in love, Sent us the best from heaven above, Saying to all of men today, God rich In mercy, God rich in mercy. A prophet God sent to restore His word As its recorded in Malachi 4 Behold I'll send you Elijah before that day What's been destroyed I will restore, Proving to men God keeps His word, Now they can see what I've revealed, I'm rich in mercy. CHORUS God rich in mercy, God rich in mercy, Sent us His Son, we were undone, God rich In mercy; God rich In grace,God rich in love, Sent us the best from heaven above, Saying to all of men today, God rich In mercy, God rich in mercy.
