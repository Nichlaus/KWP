 I hear the sound of a mighty rushing wind, And it's closer now than it's ever been; I can almost hear the trumpet as Gabriel sounds the call And at the midnight cry, we'll be going home. CHORUS When Jesus steps out On a cloud to call out God's children The dead in Christ shall rise to meet Him in the air And then those that remain,will be quickly changed At the midnight cry When Jesus comes again. I look around,I see prophecies fulfilled And the signs of the times are everywhere I can almost hear my Father as He says Son go get my children And at the midnight cry (thank God) This bride of Christ is gonna rise. CHORUS When Jesus steps up On the cloud before God's children The dead In Christ shall rise To meet Him in the air And then those that remain, Will be quickly changed At the midnight cry (x2) When Jesus comes again.  And then those that remain  Will be quickly changed  At the midnight cry (x2)  When Jesus comes again.
