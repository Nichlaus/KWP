 I was down as low as one could go I had no strength of my own Everything I worked for all my life Everything I loved was gone The lowest valley of my life I was flat on my face But then the great hand of Jesus Reached down and picked me up Oh yes, I know grace CHORUS Do you know grace, Amazing grace? Have you heard how sweet the sound? There are many dangers toils and snares, Weve already faced, Look where you came from, And where you are And Ill ask you, Do you know grace? When it comes for Him to take His bride To that evergreen shore, And He chooses you and I, When weve been there ten thousand years And you see me in that place Oh! You should ask me this question again, Ill say yes! I remember grace. CHORUS Do you know grace, Amazing grace? Have you heard how sweet the sound? There are many dangers toils and snares, Weve already faced, Look where you came from, And where you are And Ill ask you, Do you know grace?
