 When sorrow comes your way And your blue skies turn to grey No matter where you may roam He'll be your nearest friend And He'll go with you to the end You will always find God at home. CHORUS He is always at home, He's always at home, Just knock and you'll find Him at home. Your neighbours and your Friends May go away for long weekends But you'll always find God at home. When it comes life fleeting breath And you face the hand of death No more of this earth you'll roam He'll be your faithful guide And He'll stay right by your side You will always find God at home. CHORUS He is always at home, He's always at home, Just knock and you'll find Him at home. Your neighbours and your Friends May go away for long weekends But you'll always find God at home.
