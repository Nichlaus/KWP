 Where He may lead me I will go For I have learned to trust Him so And I remember twas for me That He was slain on calvary CHORUS Jesus will lead me night and day, Jesus will lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, For I remember Calvary O I delight in His command Love to be led by His dear hand His divine will is sweet to me Hallowed by blood- stained Calvary CHORUS Jesus will lead me night and day, Jesus will lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, For I remember Calvary Onward I go, nor doubt nor fear, Happy with Christ, my saviour, near, Trusting some day that I shall see Jesus, my friend of Calvary CHORUS Jesus will lead me night and day, Jesus will lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, For I remember Calvary
