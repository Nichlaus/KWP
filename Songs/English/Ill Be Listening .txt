 When the Saviour calls I will answer, When He calls for me I will hear; When the Saviour calls I will answer, I'll be somewhere list^ning for my name. CHORUS I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name; I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name. If my heart is right when He calls me, If my heart is right I will hear; If my heart is right when He calls me, I'll be somewhere listening for my name. CHORUS I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name; I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name. If my robe is white when He calls me, If my robe is white I will hear; If my robe is white when He calls me, I'll be somewhere listening for my name. CHORUS I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name; I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening for my name.
