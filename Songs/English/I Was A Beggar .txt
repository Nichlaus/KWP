 I was a beggar when I found this goldmine I was a stranger within,without a song, But now I can sing I'm a child of a King Just wait till you see my new home CHORUS Cause I'm as wealthy as a King in a palace I have riches that's never been told, With Jesus I'm an heir so I'm a millionaire For I feel like my pockets Are full of diamonds and gold. I guess I'll never have a lot of money But I'm so rich with Him in my soul Yes I'd rather have His peace if it means all the tears For I feel like my pockets are full of diamonds and gold. CHORUS Cause I'm as wealthy as a King in a palace I have riches that's never been told, With Jesus I'm an heir so I'm a millionaire For I feel like my pockets Are full of diamonds and gold.
