 Shepherd of my soul I give you full control, Wherever you may lead I will follow. I have made a choice To listen to your voice Wherever you may lead I will go. Be it on a quiet pasture Or by a gentle stream The Shepherd of my soul Is by my side. Should I face a mighty mountain Or a valley dark and deep The Shepherd of my soul Will be my guide.
