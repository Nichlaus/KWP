 CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky. I was standing by my window On a cold and cloudy day When I saw the horse come rolling For to carry my mother away. CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky. Lord I told that undertaker Undertaker please drive slow For that lady you are hauling Lord I hate to see her go. CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky. I will follow close behind her Try to hold up and be brave But I could not hide my sorrow When they laid her in the grave. CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky. Went back home, my home was lonesome Since my mother she had gone, Found my brothers, sisters crying What a home so sad and lonely. CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky. Glory, glory hallelujah, It will be a glorious day Glory, glory, hallelujah We shall meet to part no more. CHORUS Will the circle be unbroken By and by,Lord by and by There's a better home awaiting In the sky Lord In the sky.
