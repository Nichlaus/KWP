 Someday when I travel My last mile here The call will be coming for me I will enter the lifeboat, that will be near To carry me over deaths sea CHORUS Hell hold my hand As over deaths river I go And safe I will be In beautiful heaven I know My boat will sail safely Though the waters dash high For Jesus will be by my side Hell calm the rough waters And by and by Ill cross the river so wide CHORUS Hell hold my hand As over deaths river I go And safe I will be In beautiful heaven I know
