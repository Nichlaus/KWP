 When my life on earth is ended And I cross the rolling tides And the beauty of the glory land I see Many saints, friends and loved ones Will be waiting over there But I long to see the one who died for me. CHORUS Oh Just think about the glory Of the land beyond the sky Oh just think about the beauty We shall see by and by Many things on earth we value Will be common over there But I long to see the one who died for me. Even though I may have suffered Many things on earth below If I have kept the faith and lived in victory My reward will there be waiting When I enter heavens gates And the shining face of Jesus I shall see. CHORUS Oh Just think about the glory Of the land beyond the sky Oh just think about the beauty We shall see by and by Many things on earth we value Will be common over there But I long to see the one who died for me.
