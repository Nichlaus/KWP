 There will be many that day, come to Jesus and say, Haven't I not preached the gospel and prayed in your name, But Jesus will say, I never, even knew you You turned down the truth that I sent your day. CHORUS I sent forth a man with the spirit of Elijah He had THUS SAITH THE LORD And He cried out against sin, He cried come out, don't partake of their evils And he said follow me,like I follow Christ. There was a sign for the Gentiles,as Paul had in his day It was the pillar of fire that met him on the way Now if you won't believe what His servant had to say : You'll be judged by the word and Jesus will say... CHORUS I sent forth a man with the spirit of Elijah He had THUS SAITH THE LORD And He cried out against sin, He cried come out, don't partake of their evils And he said follow me,like I follow Christ.
