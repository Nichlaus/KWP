 There have been kings with riches untold They have worn crowns of diamonds and gold But there was a King who was better than them all And the crown that He wore was a crown of thorns. CHORUS A crown of thorns was placed upon His head He hang on the cross until He was dead The sky was dark with the raging storms When they crowned the King of Kings With a crown of thorns. They were so cruel to my Saviour and King He died for our sins,salvation to bring He is the King of Kings,the greatest ever born And the crown that He wore was a crown of thorns. CHORUS A crown of thorns was placed upon His head He hang on the cross until He was dead The sky was dark with the raging storms When they crowned the King of Kings With a crown of thorns.
