Abide with me! Fast falls the even-tide;The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!When other helpers fail and comforts flee,Help of the helpless, O, abide with me.Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;Change and decay in all around I see;O thou who changest not, abide with meNot a brief glance I ask nor passing word,But as thou dwell`st with thy disciples, Lord,Familiar, condensing, patient, at no cost,Come, not to so-journ, but abide with me.I need thy presence ev`ry passing hour;What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s pow`r:Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?Thro` cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.
