I heard an old storyHow a Saviour came from glory,How He gave His life on Calvary,To save a wretch like me;I heard about His groaningOf His precious blood's atoning,Then I repented of my sinsAnd won the victoryCHORUSOh, victory in JesusMy Saviour, forever,He sought me and bought meWith His redeeming blood;He loved me ere I knew HimAnd all my love is due Him,He plunged me to victory,Beneath the cleansing blood.I heard about His healing,Of His cleansing pow'r revealingHow He made the lame to walk againAnd Caused the blind to see;And then I cried, Dear Jesus,Come and heal my broken spirit,And somehow Jesus came and brought,To me the victory.CHORUSOh, victory in JesusMy Saviour, forever,He sought me and bought meWith His redeeming blood;He loved me ere I knew HimAnd all my love is due Him,He plunged me to victory,Beneath the cleansing blood.I heard about a mansion,He has built for me in glory,And I heard about the streets of goldBeyond the crystal sea;About the angels singing,And the old redemption story,And some sweet day I'll sing up thereThe song of victory.CHORUSOh, victory in JesusMy Saviour, forever,He sought me and bought meWith His redeeming blood;He loved me ere I knew HimAnd all my love is due Him,He plunged me to victory,Beneath the cleansing blood.
