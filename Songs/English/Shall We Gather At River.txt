Shall we gather at the river,Where bright angels feet have trod,With its crystal tide forever,Flowing by the throne of God?CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.On the bosom of the river,Where the Saviour-King we own,We shall meet and sorrow never,'Neath the glory of the throne.CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.On the margin of the river,Washing up its silver spray,We will walk and worship ever,All the happy, golden day.CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.Ere we reach the shining river,Lay we every burden down;Grace our spirits will deliverAnd provide a robe and crown.CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.At the smiling of the river,Mirror of the Saviour's face,Saints whom death will never severLift their songs of saving grace.CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.Soon we'll reach the shining river,Soon our pilgrimage will cease;Soon our happy hearts will quiverWith the melody of peace.CHORUSYes, we'll gather at the river,The beautiful, the beautiful river;Gather with the saints at the riverThat flows by the throne of God.
