 Every year as I grow older,the world becomes a little colder, My sinful life once filled with strife has been transformed, My sinful past I still remember,but it becomes a little dimmer, Co's its sweet,so bright and warm inside His arms. CHORUS Do you hide your face in shame, Every time you hear His name For the way you've rejected Him each day, Repent of all your misbehaviour Love and trust the blessed Saviour, Cos its sweet, so bright and warm inside His arms. If you've spent your whole life waiting Doubting Him and hesitating Worldly pleasures for you have lost their charms, In spite of all the time you've wasted, Or the dirty life you've tasted Still its sweet so bright and warm inside His arms. CHORUS Do you hide your face in shame, Every time you hear His name For the way you've rejected Him each day, Repent of all your misbehaviour Love and trust the blessed Saviour, Cos its sweet, so bright and warm inside His arms.
