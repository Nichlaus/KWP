 CHORUS Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with cords that cannot be broken, Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with love. There is only one God, There is only one King, There is only one Body, That's why I sing. CHORUS Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with cords that cannot be broken, Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with love. Made for the glory of God, Purchased by His precious Son, Born with the right to be clean, For Jesus the victory has won. CHORUS Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with cords that cannot be broken, Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with love. You are the family of God, You are the promise divine, You are God's chosen desire, You are the glorious new wine. CHORUS Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with cords that cannot be broken, Bind us together Lord, Bind us together, Bind us together with love.
