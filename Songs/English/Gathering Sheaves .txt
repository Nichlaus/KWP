 To the harvest field away we will gladly go today, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; From the early dawn till night we will labor with our might, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves. CHORUS Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; Praise the Lord, we're on our way to that land of endless day, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves. On the mountain, hill or plain we will harvest in the grain, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; Yes, we'll labor far and near, never falter, never fear, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves. CHORUS Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; Praise the Lord, we're on our way to that land of endless day, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves. We will sing and we will pray, and our Master's voice obey, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; As we go in foreign lands, doing what our Lord commands, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves. CHORUS Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves; Praise the Lord, we're on our way to that land of endless day, Gathering sheaves, beautiful sheaves.
