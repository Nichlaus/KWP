 Each time I stop to take the time to look around me, I see the signs of His appearing everywhere, The things He said would come to pass are now before us, And I feel a strange excitement in the air. CHORUS Just any day now my Lord is coming, He'll be returning for you and me, And I'll be watching,and I'll be waiting, Just any day now, His face I'll see. There's this longing in my heart for His appearing, I'll gladly leave behind trials here below, For this journey has been long and I'm so weary, But somehow I feel so closer Home. CHORUS Just any day now my Lord is coming, He'll be returning for you and me, And I'll be watching,and I'll be waiting, Just any day now, His face I'll see.
