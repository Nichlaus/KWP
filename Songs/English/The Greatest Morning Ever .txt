 I woke up this morning,wondering could this be the day, When those who beneath us are resting, Would arise to bring on that new day, Then my heart begins to beat for joy, Knowing what day that will be For the Bride will go to meet Jesus, The Bridegroom she so longs to see. CHORUS It will be the greatest morning ever, When our loved ones again we behold, This time we'll meet,never to part, With Jesus we'll always be. The signs and times, are telling us, That this is the day He'll return, There're wars and earthquakes everywhere, Hearts failing for the trouble they see, And the prophet has cried out again, Oh people return back to God, For Jesus is coming for a bride, Whose garments are spotless and white. CHORUS It will be the greatest morning ever, When our loved ones again we behold, This time we'll meet,never to part, With Jesus we'll always be.
