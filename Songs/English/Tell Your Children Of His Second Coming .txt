 Hear ye the trumpet in Zion Our Lord is coming back to earth again In the Holy mountain sound the warning Call all those who wear the yoke of sin. CHORUS Tell your children and your children's children Of the second coming of our King He will stand upon the Mount of Olives Salvation to the dying world to bring. Joel prophesied of his wisdom If we fail to walk in righteousness It will be too late to ask for mercy And the dawning of the day will end. CHORUS Tell your children and your children's children Of the second coming of our King He will stand upon the Mount of Olives Salvation to the dying world to bring.
