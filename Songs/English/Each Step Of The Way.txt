I'm following Jesus,One step at a time;I live for the moment,In His love divine,Why think of tomorrow,Just live for today;I'm following Jesus,Each step of the way.The pathway is narrow, But He leads me on;I walk in His shadow, My fears are all gone.My spirit grows stronger,Each moment, each day,For Jesus is leading Each step of the way.
