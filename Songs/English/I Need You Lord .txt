 Lord I come to you today because I have a need to pray For the troubles in my life, they are so great Lord I know beyond a doubt, that in myself thee is no way out So I pray Oh Lord youll help me find my way CHORUS I need you Lord every day I need you Lord , all the way There is no one to guide my steps Lord I have nobody else So Lord you know, I need your help For I cant make it by myself I remember very well When down on my knees I fell With a burden of my sins upon my soul When I cried in deep despair Then you came and saved me there Then I know Oh Lord that you, Can answer prayer CHORUS I need you Lord every day I need you Lord , all the way There is no one to guide my steps Lord I have nobody else So Lord you know, I need your help For I cant make it by myself
