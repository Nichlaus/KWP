 CHORUS Everywhere He went He was doing good, He gave beatitudes,fed the multitude - Everywhere He could; When the crippled saw Him, They started walking; The dumb were talking as they should Everywhere He went,my Lord was doing good. Jesus opened blind eyes, He heard the faint cry, He raised the dead and calmed the sea; Jesus mighty helper, He cleansed the lepers, And set the captive spirit free. Though the world denied Him, They crucified Him, Still He abides with us today, And His mighty power Is just the same today. CHORUS Everywhere He went He was doing good, He gave beatitudes,fed the multitude - Everywhere He could; When the crippled saw Him, They started walking; The dumb were talking as they should Everywhere He went,my Lord was doing good. Well,I've been reading, And I've been feeding Upon that blessed Word of God - Marvellous the Story, So full of glory It tells the path that Jesus trod; He was man's deliverer, A sin forgiver, and every problem Understood: Everywhere He Went, My Lord Was doing good. CHORUS Everywhere He went He was doing good, He gave beatitudes,fed the multitude - Everywhere He could; When the crippled saw Him, They started walking; The dumb were talking as they should Everywhere He went,my Lord was doing good.
