 Some of us are quiet Some of us are loud All of us are grateful None of us is proud We are not what we used to be We are better off by far And if you haven't guessed by now, We'll tell you who we are. CHORUS We are peculiar people We rejoice when things go wrong We shed tears when we are happy We sing anew glad song We are redeemed by the blood of Jesus We are the children of the heavenly King And If you care to join us Just come and sing with me Each day existing, it is a new surprise Miracles just happen, right before our eyes We don't question,where they come from For we already know that if the King should come today To heaven we will go. CHORUS We are peculiar people We rejoice when things go wrong We shed tears when we are happy We sing anew glad song We are redeemed by the blood of Jesus We are the children of the heavenly King And If you care to join us Just come and sing with me
