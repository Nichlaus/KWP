 Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must go along; Till the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes; Well the morning is bright, and the Lamb is the Light; And the night, night is as fair as the day, oh, yes. CHORUS There will be peace in the valley for me some day; There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray; There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I'll see; There will be peace in the valley for me. There the flowers will be blooming, and the grass will be green; And the skies will be clear and serene, oh, yes; Well the sun ever beams, in this valley of dreams; And no clouds there will ever be seen, oh, yes. CHORUS There will be peace in the valley for me some day; There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray; There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I'll see; There will be peace in the valley for me. Well, the bear will be gentle, and the wolf will be tame; And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes; Well the beast from the wild, shall be led by a little child; And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes. CHORUS There will be peace in the valley for me some day; There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray; There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I'll see; There will be peace in the valley for me.
