 Once a man named Stephen preached about the Lord, Folks were saved and folks were healed,as they heard his word, Satan did not like it soon he had his crowd, As they tried him,they heard Stephen cry aloud: CHORUS I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand, I see Jesus yonder in the Promised Land, Work here Is over,now I'm coming to Thee, I see Jesus,standing waiting for me. As the stones fell on him,beating out his life, Stephen knew he would be through with all trials and strives, And so much like the Master with a heart so true (he prayed) Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do. CHORUS I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand, I see Jesus yonder in the Promised Land, Work here Is over,now I'm coming to Thee, I see Jesus,standing waiting for me. Through the gates of glory,down the streets of gold, Marched the hero of the Lord into heaven's fold, As he met his Master at the great white Throne I believe He smiled and said:Stephen welcome home! CHORUS I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand, I see Jesus yonder in the Promised Land, Work here Is over,now I'm coming to Thee, I see Jesus,standing waiting for me.
