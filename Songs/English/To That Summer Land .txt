 To that summer land up yonder, Where the angels ever sing Hallelujahs to the Saviour, Sweet hosannas to the King; We are marching swiftly onward, Guided by our Father's hand Thro' this world of sin and sorrow, To that happy summer land. CHORUS Oh,. . . the joy when we get there... Golden crowns of life to wear... In that happy land so fair In that summer land up yonder. To that summer land up yonder Some are going every day, And the time is drawing nearer When we, too, shall go away; We are going straight to Jesus, There to join the ransom'd band, We will praise His Name for ever, In that happy summer land. CHORUS Oh,. . . the joy when we get there... Golden crowns of life to wear... In that happy land so fair In that summer land up yonder. In that summer land up yonder There's a place prepared for all Who are trusting in the Saviour, Who will listen to His call; And the happy time is coming When the Lord shall give command, And we'll leave this world for ever For that happy summer land. CHORUS Oh,. . . the joy when we get there... Golden crowns of life to wear... In that happy land so fair In that summer land up yonder.
