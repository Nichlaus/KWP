 It is Saturday evening the sun is almost gone, And we are looking for the coming of the Lord, The week is past and gone the day is almost spent, And it's Saturday evening of time. CHORUS The Bible is almost fulfilled, His coming is at the door, We are living in the days He spoke about, When the sun shall be darkened and the moon won't give It a light And it's Saturday evening of time. No more will our friends have to leave us, And fight the wars across the sea The stars will shine there forever By the one who shed His blood at Calvary. CHORUS The Bible is almost fulfilled, His coming is at the door, We are living in the days He spoke about, When the sun shall be darkened and the moon won't give It a light And it's Saturday evening of time. There will be peace on that day so they tell me For the former things of earth will pass away There will be no more sorrows neither crying For God Himself shall wipe away our tears. CHORUS The Bible is almost fulfilled, His coming is at the door, We are living in the days He spoke about, When the sun shall be darkened and the moon won't give It a light And it's Saturday evening of time. They say the walls are made of Jasper And they say the streets are pure gold And they tell me we'll have a lovely mansion And we'll meet our loved ones those that are gone. CHORUS The Bible is almost fulfilled, His coming is at the door, We are living in the days He spoke about, When the sun shall be darkened and the moon won't give It a light And it's Saturday evening of time.
