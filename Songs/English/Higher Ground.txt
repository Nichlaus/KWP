Am pressing on the upward way,New heights am gaining everyday;Still praying as I'm onward bound,Lord plant my feet on higher ground.CHORUSLord, lift me up and let me stand,A higher plain than I have found,Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.My heart has no desire to stayWhere doubts arise and fears dismays;Tho'some may dwell where these abound,My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.CHORUSLord, lift me up and let me stand,By faith, on heaven's tables land,A higher plain than I have found,Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.I want to scale the utmost height,And catch a gleam of glory bright;But I'll pray till heav'n I've foundLord lead me onto higher ground.CHORUSLord, lift me up and let me stand,By faith, on heaven's tables land,A higher plain than I have found,Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
