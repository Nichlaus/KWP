 Come,Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise. Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God; He,to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood. Oh,to grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be! Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love: Here's my heart; Lord,take and seal it, Seal it from Thy courts above.
