 O my brother, do you know the Savior, Who is wondrous, kind and true? He's the Rock of your salvation! There^s Honey in the Rock for you. CHORUS Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, my brother. There's Honey in the Rock for you; Leave your sins for the blood to cover, There's Honey in the Rock for you. Have you tasted that the Lord is gracious? Do you walk in the way that's new? Have you drank from the living Fountain? There's Honey in the Rock for you. CHORUS Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, my brother. There's Honey in the Rock for you; Leave your sins for the blood to cover, There's Honey in the Rock for you. Do you pray unto God the Father, What wilt thou have me to do? Never fear He will surely answer; There's Honey in the Rock for you. CHORUS Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, my brother. There's Honey in the Rock for you; Leave your sins for the blood to cover, There's Honey in the Rock for you. Then go out through the streets and byways, Preach the word to the many or few; Say to every fallen brother, There's Honey in the Rock for you. CHORUS Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, my brother. There's Honey in the Rock for you; Leave your sins for the blood to cover, There's Honey in the Rock for you.
