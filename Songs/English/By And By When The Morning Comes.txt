We are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time,Sombre skies and howling tempests oft succeed a bright sunshine;In that land of perfect day,when the mist have rolled away,We will understand it better by and by.CHORUSBy and by when that morning comes,When all the saints of God are gathered home,We will tell the story of how we overcome,For we^ll understand it better by and by.We are often destitute of the things that life demands,Want of food and want for shelter, thirsty hills and barren lands,But we're trusting in the Lord, and according to His Word,We will understand it better by and by.CHORUSBy and by when that morning comes,When all the saints of God are gathered home,We will tell the story of how we overcome,For we'll understand it better by and by.Trials dark on every hand, and we cannot understand,All the ways that God would lead us to that blessed Promised Land;But He guides us with His eye and we^ll follow till we die,For we'll understand it better by and by.CHORUSBy and by when that morning comes,When all the saints of God are gathered home,We will tell the story of how we overcome,For we'll understand it better by and by.Temptations, hidden snares often take us unawares,And our hearts are made to bleed for many a thoughtless word or deed,And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best,But we'll understand it better by and by.CHORUSBy and by when that morning comes,When all the saints of God are gathered home,We will tell the story of how we overcome,For we'll understand it better by and by.
