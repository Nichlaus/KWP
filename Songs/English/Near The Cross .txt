 Jesus, keep me near the cross, There a precious fountain, Free to all, a healing stream, Flows from Calv'ry's mountain. CHORUS In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river. Near the cross, a trembling soul, Love and mercy found me; There the Bright and Morning Star Sheds its beams around me. CHORUS In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river. Near the cross! O lamb of God, Bring its scenes before me; Help me walk from day to day, With its shadows over me. CHORUS In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river. Near the cross I'll watch and wait, Hoping, trusting, ever. Till I reach the golden strand, Just beyond the river. CHORUS In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever; Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river.
