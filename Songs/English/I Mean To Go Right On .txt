 I mean to go right on until the crown is worn I mean to fight the fight of faith, Till life on earth is done; I'll never more turn back,defeat I shall not know, For God will give me victory if onward I will go (Am going on) CHORUS Am going on, going on Am going on Until the final triumph Am going on, am going on Until the final triumph am going on (Am going on Should opposition come should foes obstruct my way Should persecutions fires be as in the ancient days With Jesus by my side,His peace within my soul, No matter if the battle is hot, I mean to reach the goal (Am going on) CHORUS Am going on, going on Am going on Until the final triumph Am going on, am going on Until the final triumph am going on (am going on) I see a shining crown awaiting over there I see a mansion well prepared and decked with beauties rare Should that which intervenes deprive me of my right way Nay I'go on until I reach the city of the delight (am going on) CHORUS Am going on, going on Am going on Until the final triumph Am going on, am going on Until the final triumph am going on (Am going on) Then forward let us go our hearts with love aflame Our showy banner borne aloft inscribed with Jesus Name The hosts of evil flee,And heavens open gate Invite me to enter where eternal glory waits (Am going on) CHORUS Am going on, going on Am going on Until the final triumph Am going on, am going on Until the final triumph am going on (Am going on)
