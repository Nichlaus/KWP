 CHORUS Learning to lean,learning to lean I'm Learning to lean on Jesus Gaining more power than I ever dreamed I'm learning to lean on Jesus. The joy I can't explain it fills my soul Since I found Jesus my King, His blessed Holy Spirit is leading my way And He is teaching me Oh am I am learning to lean. CHORUS Learning to lean,learning to lean I'm Learning to lean on Jesus Gaining more power than I ever dreamed I'm learning to lean on Jesus. There's glorious victory each day now for me I found His peace so serene, He helps me with each task If only I will ask Every day now I am learning to lean. Thank God Oh... CHORUS Learning to lean,learning to lean I'm Learning to lean on Jesus Gaining more power than I ever dreamed I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
