 Jesus went to the temple When He was only twelve His words startled the elders As His wisdom they beheld; And the multitude that followed To hear the man from Galilee Never a man spake like this man When He said Come follow me. CHORUS Never a man spake like this man The glorious King of Kings He spake to my troubled soul And now my heart sings He has promised in His Holy Word Some day His face I'll see Never a man spake like this man When He said come follow me He calmed the troubled waters With a few words from His lips The lame walked, the dumb talked When He said to them be healed: And Lazarus came forth from the grave When he heard the Master speak Never a man spake like this man When He said come follow me. CHORUS Never a man spake like this man The glorious King of Kings He spake to my troubled soul And now my heart sings He has promised in His Holy Word Some day His face I'll see Never a man spake like this man When He said come follow me
