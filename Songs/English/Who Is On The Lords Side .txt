 Who is on the Lord's side? Who will serve the King? Who will be His helper Other lives to bring? Who will leave the world's side? Who will face the foe? Who is on the Lord's side? Who for Him will go? CHORUS By Thy grand redemption, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side: Saviour, we are Thine! Not for weight of glory, Not for crown and palm, Enter we the army, Raise the warrior-palm; But for love that claimeth Lives for whom He died: He whom Jesus nameth Must be on His side! CHORUS By Thy love constraining, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine. Jesus,Thou hast bought us, Not with gold or gem, But with Thine own life-blood, For Thy diadem: With Thy blessing filling All who come to Thee, Thou has made us willing, Thou has made us free. CHORUS By Thy grand redemption, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine! Fierce may be the conflict, Strong may be the foe, But the King's own army None can overthrow; Round His standard raging, Victory is secure, For His truth unchanging, Makes the triumph sure. CHORUS Joyfully enlisting, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side: Saviour,we are Thine! Chosen to be soldiers In an alien land, Chosen, called, and faithful, For our Captain's band. In His service royal, Let us not grow cold; Let us be right loyal, Noble,true,and bold. CHORUS Master,Thou wilt keep us, By Thy grace divine, Always on the Lord's side, Saviour,always Thine
