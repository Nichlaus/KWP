Some glorious morning sorrow will cease,Some glorious morning all will be peace,Heartaches all ended, schooldays all done,Heaven will open, Jesus will come.CHORUSSome golden daybreak, Jesus will come;Some golden daybreak, battles all won,He'll shout the victory, break through the blue,Some golden daybreak, for me, for you.Sad hearts will gladden, all shall be bright,Good-bye forever to earth's dark night;Changed in a moment, like Him to be,Oh, glorious daybreak, Jesus I'll see.CHORUSSome golden daybreak, Jesus will come;Some golden daybreak, battles all won,He'll shout the victory, break through the blue,Some golden daybreak, for me, for you.Oh, what a meeting, there in the skies,No tears nor crying shall dim our eyes;Loved ones united eternally,Oh, what a daybreak that morn will be.CHORUSSome golden daybreak, Jesus will come;Some golden daybreak, battles all won,He'll shout the victory, break through the blue,Some golden daybreak, for me, for you.
