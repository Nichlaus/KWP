 There is a ship called the old ship of Zion And it's passing this way just one more time, And I got my ticket waiting for the rapture, And my heart is longing for that final day. CHORUS The old ship of Zion will soon be coming in Then I shall step upon it and leave this world of sin, I'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye And I'll go sailing through the sky For the ship of Zion will soon be coming in. (Yes the ship of Zion will Soon be coming In) Not long ago, a prophet came on to earth And he brought us 'Thus says the Lord' And he said you better get your ticket ready, For without the token you can't get on board. CHORUS The old ship of Zion will soon be coming in Then I shall step upon it and leave this world of sin, I'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye And I'll go sailing through the sky For the ship of Zion will soon be coming in. (Yes the ship of Zion will Soon be coming In)
