 Standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus, He's the One who always cares and understands; Standing somewhere in the shadows you will find Him, And you'll know Him by the nail prints in his hands. CHORUS I shall know Him, I shall know Him, As redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know Him By the prints of the nails in His hands.
