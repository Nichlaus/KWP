 When I was straying out in sin My Jesus spoke to me His voice I certainly heard as ' He said Come unto me I'll make you a pure child of God And get you free from sin If you'll open your heart and let me in. CHORUS When Jesus knocked at my heart's door I let Him in He came inside and found my heart Was stained in sin He gave me joy and peace the world Could never know, He took my heart and washed it white And spotless as snow, I'm happy now and other souls I will help to win, Since I opened up my heart and let Him in. When Jesus knocked at my heart's door I wanted Him to stay, When I yielded to Him all my burdens rolled away, And now I know why Jesus died Upon the cross that day, When I opened up my heart and let Him in. CHORUS When Jesus knocked at my heart's door I let Him in He came inside and found my heart Was stained in sin He gave me joy and peace the world Could never know, He took my heart and washed it white And spotless as snow, I'm happy now and other souls I will help to win, Since I opened up my heart and let Him in.
