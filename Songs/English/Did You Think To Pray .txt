 E're you left your room this morning, Did you think to pray, In the Name of Christ our Saviour, Did you ask for loving favour as a shield today. CHORUS Oh how praying rests the weary, Prayer will change the night today, So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray. When you met with great temptation, Did you think to pray, By His dying love and merit Did you claim the Holy Spirit as your guide and stay. CHORUS Oh how praying rests the weary, Prayer will change the night today, So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray. When your heart was filled with anger Did you think to pray, Did you plead for grace my brother That you might forgive another Who has crossed your way. CHORUS Oh how praying rests the weary, Prayer will change the night today, So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray.
