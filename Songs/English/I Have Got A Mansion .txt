 I'm satisfied with just a cottage below, A little silver and a little gold, But in that city, where the ransomed will shine I'll want a gold one, that's silvery lined. CHORUS I've got a mansion, just over the hill top In that bright land where we'll never grow old But some day yonder we'll never more wander But walk the streets that are as pure as gold. Though often tempted,tormented and tested, And like the prophet,my pillow a stone And though I find here no permanent dwelling I know He'll give me a mansion of my own. CHORUS I've got a mansion, just over the hill top In that bright land where we'll never grow old But some day yonder we'll never more wander But walk the streets that are as pure as gold. Don't think me poor and deserted or lonely, I am not discouraged, I'm heavenly bound I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city I know He'll give me a mansion of my own. CHORUS I've got a mansion, just over the hill top In that bright land where we'll never grow old But some day yonder we'll never more wander But walk the streets that are as pure as gold.
