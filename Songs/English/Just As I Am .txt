 Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Just as I am, Thou wilt received, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Just as I am, Thy love unknown Hath broken every barrier down; Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, O Lamb of God, I come! I come!
