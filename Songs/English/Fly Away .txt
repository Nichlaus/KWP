 Lately I've been thinking, As I look all around me I see by the signs,that we'll soon be flying home The bridegroom is coming,to take us all away It may be tomorrow, but I^m praying that it is today. CHORUS And we will, Fly, fly away,in the twinkling of an eye Leaving all our hurting. And telling them all good-bye Yes we will Fly, fly away when we hear the Father say Jesus go and get the bride,for today I our wedding day. And when we see the bridegroom coming In the clouds in the sky Will He be saying hello! Or telling you goodbye Oh just be sure and be ready,to meet Him face to face We've got to fight a good fight We've got to keep our faith. CHORUS And we will, Fly, fly away,in the twinkling of an eye Leaving all our hurting. And telling them all good-bye Yes we will Fly, fly away when we hear the Father say Jesus go and get the bride,for today I our wedding day.
