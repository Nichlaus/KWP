 I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today, It put me on that straight and narrow way And now it makes me happy to say, That I've heard that eagle call today. CHORUS I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today, Malachi 4 and 5 is the way, No matter what people do And no matter what people say, I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today. This eagle prophet brought a special message He gave us life by giving us the Word, The true interpretation of the hour Oh friends I've heard the eagle call. CHORUS I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today, Malachi 4 and 5 is the way, No matter what people do And no matter what people say, I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today. This eagle came flying over my way Then all at once I recognized my day And it's message then became my aim For my heart received the eagle call. CHORUS I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today, Malachi 4 and 5 is the way, No matter what people do And no matter what people say, I'm glad I've heard the eagle call today.
