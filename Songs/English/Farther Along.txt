Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonderWhy it should be thus all that day long,While there are others living about us,Never molested though in the wrong.CHORUSFarther along we'll know all about it,Farther along will understand why;Cheer up, my brother,Living in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.When death has come taken our loved ones,It leaves our home so lonely and drear;Then do we wonder why others prosperLiving so wicked year after year.CHORUSFarther along we^ll know all about it,Farther along will understand why;Cheer up, my brother,Living in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.Faithful till death said our loving Master,A few more days to labour and wait;Toils of the road will then seem as nothing,As we sing through the beautiful gate.CHORUSFarther along we'll know all about it,Farther along will understand why;Cheer up, my brother,Living in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.When we see Jesus coming in glory,When HE comes from His home in the sky;Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,We'll understand it all by and by.CHORUSFarther along we'll know all about it,Farther along will understand why;Cheer up, my brother,Living in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.
