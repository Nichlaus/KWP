 I am longing for the morning, The day of the rapture When Jesus will take home His bride, To the place prepared to live eternally I hope to be there in that meeting. CHORUS Oh, Lord take my hand, This Is my plea And lead me safely home, Let me not miss it Lord But be there in that meeting. Now the prophet has gone, And our days here are numbered Dear pilgrim don't loose your vision, Just a few more days to wait for His coming, Press on pilgrim to the rapture. CHORUS Oh, Lord take my hand, This Is my plea And lead me safely home, Let me not miss it Lord But be there in that meeting. I'll cling to Jesus my only hope and guide, This world cannot hold me no longer, I'm going home that precious land above, Oh precious are the memories of my home above. CHORUS Oh, Lord take my hand, This Is my plea And lead me safely home, Let me not miss it Lord But be there in that meeting. My heart keeps longing to get the great reward, That awaits the faithful,in that glorious land, Lord lead me through,I'll trust They Word, Till I reach home above and see Thy face. CHORUS Oh, Lord take my hand, This Is my plea And lead me safely home, Let me not miss it Lord But be there in that meeting.
