 CHORUS Where will you stand on judgement day You better make your mind up right away You say there's time you'll enter in But how long have you lived In sin Now tell me,on that day where will you stand? Now the Bible tells that the Word of God Is revealed to a prophet, In Amos three and seven it's found Now the Prophet has all come and gone And we are waiting for the rapture When the Lord will take the waiting Bride away. CHORUS Where will you stand on judgement day You better make your mind up right away You say there's time you'll enter in But how long have you lived In sin Now tell me,on that day where will you stand? There's a tribulation time that's wrote In the book of Revelation The Bride will be in glory before that time The spirit of God shall be taken away And the wicked shall remain With those that rejected God's messenger that came. CHORUS Where will you stand on judgement day You better make your mind up right away You say there's time you'll enter in But how long have you lived In sin Now tell me,on that day where will you stand?
