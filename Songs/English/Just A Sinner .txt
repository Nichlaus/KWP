 If you could see what I once was If you could go with me Back to where I started from Then I know you would see A miracle of love that took me In a sweet embrace and made me what I am today Just a sinner saved by grace. CHORUS I'm just a sinner, saved by grace When I stood condemned to death He took my place And now I live and breath in freedom Every step of life I take I'm loved and forgiven Back with the living I'm just a sinner, saved by grace. How could I boast of anything That I've ever seen or done How could I dare to claim as mine The victories God has won Where would I be Had God not brought me Gently to this place I'm here to say I'm nothing but An old sinner saved by grace. CHORUS I'm just a sinner, saved by grace When I stood condemned to death He took my place And now I live and breath in freedom Every step of life I take I'm loved and forgiven Back with the living I'm just a sinner, saved by grace.
