 Glorious peace that never shall cease, Heartaches can't enter,those beautiful streets, No pain, no woe, no rich, no poor, It's glorious to know that we're nearing the shore. CHORUS We're nearing the shore, we're nearing the shore, Troubles soon will be over we'll suffer no more, Trials all past, it's victory at last, Oh It is wonderful to be nearing the shore. We'll see the Lighthouse Jesus Divine, He will say welcome,children of mine, Come in and rest,this land possess, Oh it is wonderful to be nearing the shore. CHORUS We're nearing the shore, we're nearing the shore, Troubles soon will be over we'll suffer no more, Trials all past, it's victory at last, Oh It is wonderful to be nearing the shore.
