 If Jesus should come x 2 I will welcome the call from on high There is nothing to hold me No money nor home, I'll leave without saying good-bye. CHORUS I'm longing (to go x 2) If the trumpet Lord should sound From the mansions on high I'll leave without saying good- bye. My garments are spotless I've washed my robes white For the blood is flowing over my soul The way is so clear Though it's dark as the night For a saint keeps his eyes on the goal. CHORUS I'm longing (to go x 2) If the trumpet Lord should sound From the mansions on high I'll leave without saying good- bye
