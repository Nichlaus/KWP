 If you could own all the world and its money Build castles tall enough to reach the sky above If you could know everything there is to know in all the earth Yet you know nothing,Until you know God and His Love. CHORUS Until you know the loving hand, That reaches down to a fallen man, And lifts him up from out of sin Where he has dropped Until you know the power how with you To know that God Is really real, Then you know nothing,until you know The Love of God. If in your life time you could meet everybody If you could call every name from here to yonder But if you've not come face to face with Jesus and His saving grace, Then you know nothing until you know God and His Love CHORUS Until you know the loving hand, That reaches down to a fallen man, And lifts him up from out of sin Where he has dropped Until you know the power how with you To know that God Is really real, Then you know nothing,until you know The Love of God.
