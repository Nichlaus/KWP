 I'm a pilgrim and a stranger Wandering through this world of sin, On my way to that fair city, When the Saints go marching in. CHORUS When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Oh, I know I'll see my Saviour If my life is free from sin, Heaven's doors will open for me When the Saints go marching in. CHORUS When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. When we gather round the Throne And the gates are closed within, I'll be shouting Glory, Glory When the Saints go marching in. CHORUS When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. I'm waiting for the chariot To swing low and I'll step in, On the clouds I'll ride to Heaven When the Saints go marching in. CHORUS When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in.
