 I have a longing in this heart of mine I want to be yes, to be nearer to Thee, I want to be holy for I will be Thine Draw me I pray day after day nearer to Thee. CHORUS Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee Oh (blessed Lord) x2 this Is my plea I want to stand, on heaven's fair land (where I will be) x 2 nearer to Thee. If I am faithful, Thy face I'll behold Some happy day some day on heaven's shore And I shall walk those streets of pure gold Where I will be nearer to Thee. CHORUS Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee Oh (blessed Lord) x2 this Is my plea I want to stand, on heaven^s fair land (where I will be) x 2 nearer to Thee.
